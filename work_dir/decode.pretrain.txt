you know , one of the great school projects in traveling , and one of the joys of <unk> research is to live with the people who live still in the wind , and that they see in the <unk> of the stones , they can <unk> taste of the fruits of the plants .
just knowing that <unk> can still travel beyond the milky way , or the importance of myths that the oldest of us are still familiar , or in the himalayas that live to keep the buddhist <unk> of consciousness .
and of course , we share all the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we &apos;re running through .
we have to come up with the <unk> <unk> through death , so it may not surprise us that we all sing , dance and creating art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the <unk> <unk> of play , the rhythm of dance , every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s about the <unk> in the forests of borneo or the <unk> in haiti , or the warriors in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , everest , the <unk> of the world .
all these people teach us that there are other other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways for guidance on earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , can never meet with hope .
together together , the myriad of cultures around the world is a web of <unk> and <unk> , which is the earth <unk> , and that probably the earth is as important as the biological <unk> that you see as a biosphere .
you can think of this cultural icon as a <unk> <unk> , which is when the <unk> of all thoughts and dreams are myths , inspiration and intuitions that are made of the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we &apos;re doing is , what we &apos;re seeing is amazing .
and just as the biosphere had been <unk> , this was only with greater speed .
no biologist would propose to say that 50 percent or more of all species are before the brink of extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> of the field of cultural diversity -- that &apos;s hardly what we think is known as the <unk> of cultural diversity .
and the critical point of it is extinction .
when everyone was born in this room , they were talking about 6,000 languages .
now , language is not just the sum of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the finds of the soul to find access to the physical world .
each language is like a <unk> forest of mind , an inflection point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of these 6,000 languages , today , as we sit here in monterey , they &apos;re just not paying the ears in monterey .
they don &apos;t teach children on five years , which means that nothing happens , they &apos;re actually dead .
what might be more lonely than being silence is to be one of the last person in your people who speak their language , not to have the ability to pass the ancestors of ancestors , or to hope for children ?
and yet this horrible thing happens to tell someone that on earth , about two weeks , because every two weeks , a woman dies , the older man comes back to the grave .
and i know that some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t that better ? &quot;
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then suddenly you would see how it would be like if you could not speak your own language .
so i &apos;d like to take you through this journey through the journey of <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> , to try to make them understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us who are in forgetting something that i am , as i say , &quot; different ways of being , &quot; really different ways of being .
take the example of the child in the northwest of the amazon , the <unk> of the <unk> , the people who are <unk> in the middle of the <unk> in the belly in saint belly in <unk> .
this is a people who doesn &apos;t think cognitively between the color and the green is because the <unk> of the forest that is dependent upon people on them .
they have a strange language , and a <unk> <unk> is called the <unk> , you have to marry somebody who speak a different language .
all this is rooted in the recent past , the <unk> of these great houses where the <unk> talks about six or seven spoke , though , is that you never hear somebody who is learning a language .
they just stop listening and start to speak .
or , one of the most intriguing strains that i &apos;ve ever lived , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people that came to arrive at late <unk> .
in the year of 1957 , they were trying to contact five <unk> , and made a mistake .
they <unk> shiny photographs from the air , which we would be considered a friendly gesture , and forgot that these people from the rainforest have never seen had seen their lives .
they took these pictures of the forest floor , trying to see the face or see the character , there was nothing and <unk> that was the card card of the devil , killed the five <unk> of the gun .
but the <unk> did not only meet the spear .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by <unk> .
we went back to the last eight generations , and we found two cases of death , and when we were talking to people about it , they gave us a little bit old , because of course , he died , and he killed him .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of forests that was amazing .
their predators could smell the urine of a person from 40 steps away and determine what animal species of mine was .
in the early <unk> years , i got a really amazing job when my professor at harvard was whether i was interested in organizing to haiti and the secret societies , which were the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the poison that was used for being made to make sure .
to give you a sense , i had to give a sense of this remarkable belief in this remarkable belief , and <unk> , it &apos;s not about islam &apos;s black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex <unk> worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you to think about the great world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> , whatever .
a continent is left out , because the guess was that there are no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , of course , and there was a symbol of being very profound religious thoughts , during the tragic diaspora in <unk> .
but what makes it so interesting is that this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the live <unk> the spirits .
the spirits can come from under the big water , respond to the rhythm of the dance , to <unk> the soul of the living , so that the <unk> is for a very perfect moment for god .
<unk> , they like to say , &quot; your white goes to church and talk about god . &quot;
we dance in the temple , and we become the god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with , you &apos;re going to take off the mind . how can you be damaged with it ?
you see these amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> coal , without burning <unk> , an amazing visualization of the ability to mind the body so that it <unk> it in a state of extreme arousal .
well , all of the people i &apos;ve met , the <unk> from the sierra nevada de <unk> <unk> <unk> , the most extraordinary .
so the offspring of the ancient civilization that have conquered the caribbean <unk> <unk> of colombia , and in the aftermath of the conquest , the nation moved into a massive <unk> massively <unk> that is rising above the <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these were the only ones that were never conquered by the <unk> .
up to today &apos;s day , they will be controlled by a ritual priesthood , and the training to the priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> will be separated at three and four years from their families , and in a <unk> world of war , in <unk> at the base of the glacier , at the <unk> of the <unk> of their <unk> mother , who are now <unk> in their lap .
and throughout that time , they become culturally culturally divided into society values , values that claim their prayers and their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing day , you &apos;re going to suddenly come out of the day , and for the first time in your life , at age 18 , you see a sunrise . and in the moment of the moment , the <unk> starts to be <unk> .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about <unk> and landscape , we <unk> either <unk> , and the old myth of the very wild wild <unk> , which is in a simplification of this <unk> , or <unk> thoreau , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , <unk> are not <unk> , they &apos;re still affected by the <unk> .
there &apos;s not a lot of place in the <unk> of <unk> or the cold wind of tibet , but nevertheless , through the form of ritual , which is not based on the idea of being aware of this , because it becomes a human intuition .
well , what does that mean ?
it means that a small child from the andes who will grow up in the belief that the mountain is a <unk> that is or the fate of their own lives , will become a whole bunch of other families .
whether he &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a pile of <unk> , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defined the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia , and he believed that these forests were there to be <unk> .
that made me one other than my friends among the <unk> , the faith that these forests of <unk> and <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> spirits , the people who live on their <unk> .
well , when you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant .
it &apos;s a photograph i just took in the northwest of the amazon in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard of , the most powerful <unk> compound that comes from the repertoire of the <unk> .
what makes it so fascinating is not only the potential potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s processing . it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources .
this plant contains some very strong <unk> that is serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very much .
so if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> of how you put this stuff , this substance that it made out of different species are also <unk> .
this powder was <unk> like a <unk> shot , <unk> of <unk> paintings and the landing on a <unk> of electricity .
it becomes no distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
in fact , i have with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man who discovered the <unk> <unk> with the discovery of the magical mushrooms in mexico , in the <unk> years .
but the thing about <unk> is that they can &apos;t be approved by <unk> , because of course , in a <unk> , <unk> enzyme enzyme calls .
you can only be mixed with some other chemicals , the mao <unk> .
now the intriguing thing is that the <unk> that are contained in the <unk> are <unk> , of course , is exactly the way that &apos;s necessary for <unk> <unk> , so you ask yourself .
how can these people come from a plant of 80,000 species of plants that can find these two <unk> plants , which , if they combined it together , create a kind of <unk> version , so that the whole is larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trial and error , which appears to be meaningless .
but the american people , they tell people , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , 17 percent varieties of <unk> that you see from all of us from a forest that are looking for our eyes as a species .
and then you ask the way to justify your <unk> , and you say , &quot; i thought you know about some plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take each of the 17 versions at <unk> , and you sing them into a different <unk> .
now , that doesn &apos;t give you a ph.d. in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
now , the issue of the problem is that even those of us who have the <unk> of the <unk> of native americans , they have a sense of <unk> , and they look at them in the past , as they see in the past , in the world , in our world , progresses .
so , in fact , in the 20th century , in the age of 300 years , not to be able to remember the wars or some innovations , but rather than a era of destroying the biological and cultural diversity on earth , so the problem is not changing .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> didn &apos;t listen to be less than sioux , when they bow , and arrow , when americans don &apos;t ever be americans as their horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology will threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of domination .
and wherever you see in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not <unk> to extinction . these are dynamic living peoples , whose existence is driven by <unk> forces , whose existence of <unk> <unk>
or , when we go into the mountains of tibet where i find a lot of research , you will see the ugly face of political domination .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of people are generally <unk> , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lifestyle of the people , not only <unk> , but generally <unk> as a part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , if you haven &apos;t experienced this at <unk> .
i was traveling with a young colleague of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> through <unk> and <unk> , when i came to the face of the statistics of listening to the statistics that you hear , and 6,000 million people who were killed by the cultural revolution .
the father of this young was recognized as the followers of the dalai lama .
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle fled his <unk> in the diaspora to bring people to nepal .
his mother was imprisoned , <unk> punishment -- for the crimes of being poor .
he was born in jail for two years , in jail , hiding in her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live it .
the sister who did these brave <unk> was brought into a <unk> .
one day , they put it on <unk> on the <unk> , and she had to <unk> for this <unk> for a year .
suffering may be unbearable , but the <unk> spirit of people is a little bit of <unk> .
and at the end , we &apos;re really going to be a choice . we want to live in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist said before she died that it was their greatest fear that we are moving towards a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> worldview , we weren &apos;t just going to wake up the whole range of human imagination , forgetting that there were ever other options .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species have existed for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and in the moment that cult cult of the <unk> <unk> poetry , the poetry of <unk> through the prose of the priesthood and hierarchy , specialization and <unk> -- found only a thousand years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges we are facing in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask these <unk> <unk> about the importance of human beings , answers them with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will become the ability to be what we are : people with full awareness that are aware of the importance that all people and garden can be able to flourish , and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photo i took at the northern pole of the <unk> when i went to <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the eastern government has not always worked very well with the inuit , and during the course of the <unk> of <unk> , they were forced to draw in settlements .
the grandfather of this old refused refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit have no fear of the cold ; they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> of their sled was actually made of fish that was wrapped in <unk> .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the dark storm .
he &apos;d gone out outside , his legs made out of <unk> and <unk> in his hand . and when the feces began to slow , he formed them into the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> on the sides of the <unk> , and it was frozen frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and improvising a dishes , took the skeleton of the dog and improvising a <unk> , <unk> a different dog and <unk> about the <unk> with the <unk> to the <unk> .
so you can &apos;t do anything .
and this is a symbol of many of the inuit , and all the native people in the world .
the eastern government gave the australian islands in april of 1999 , and complete the total control over a field , larger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home and it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent independent area . they control all the <unk> .
an amazing example of a nation , a state , who have been <unk> to their own lives .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who &apos;ve traveled to these distant goals of the world , to realize that they &apos;re not away from all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that experiences in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are , of the west of the rest of hope .
what we do at national geographic eventually is that we believe politicians never do something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website is 35 million <unk> each month .
eleven nations send our <unk> .
our magazines will read millions of millions .
and we &apos;re going to run a series of travel in <unk> , where we &apos;re looking at our audiences in places of such cultural wonder that they &apos;re <unk> by some of the <unk> , and hopefully , they become one of the <unk> of <unk> civilization , which is the wisdom of all of our human well-being .
thank you .
what i &apos;m going to do with you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we think microsoft is as a part of a <unk> , which is <unk> , and it &apos;s an area where it can be locally and distant with vast amounts of visual data .
we see many , lots of pages of photos that are seamlessly , and continually <unk> , <unk> the <unk> .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is an scan scan , and it &apos;s in a domain of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that the performance of a system like this can be , is the number of pixels on your screen at each moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this is a representation of the <unk> and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that &apos;s really what you want to do and enjoy the good experience of a real <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a number of scales of scales .
we also have something in the corner of this particular piece of the guardian .
we &apos;ve created a false ad with very high resolution , which is much higher than a regular display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of these cars , you can see here .
or other models , or some technical specs .
and this is actually taking these ideas to open up the constraints of the space .
we hope that this is no longer <unk> and more nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
of course , this is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we will be contributing to this domain .
but these are all roads roads .
<unk> up at the <unk> picture of nasa .
let &apos;s get a little further .
now , this is now live on the internet . they can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> that connects to the two different kinds of technologies .
one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> , which is , from noah <unk> , a <unk> of the university of steve <unk> at the university of steve <unk> at <unk>
and rick <unk> of microsoft research was done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s powered by <unk> .
you can see that , if we can create these kind of ideas where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of <unk> resolution .
but the spatial orientation of the imagery is actually what matters .
the <unk> had these pictures together to give it to the real room , and that these photographs that were all <unk> around <unk> in the canadian <unk> , and they see a series of <unk> slides , or <unk> <unk> , and these things have been related to each other .
i don &apos;t know if i have time to show you other environments .
there are some things that are much more <unk> .
i &apos;d like to walk straight to the <unk> data of noah , and this is from a early prototype of <unk> that we first worked on in the summer to show you what i believe is that it &apos;s not exactly obvious if you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers .
this is a <unk> cathedral of the lady , which is taken exclusively in the computer with pictures of pictures , and i just pick up the dame dame in flickr , and they &apos;re taking pictures of men in <unk> and on the floor , and each of those orange orange represents a picture that has been discovered as this model .
so these are all <unk> , and they all have in the same time in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i didn &apos;t believe that i &apos;m going to work at microsoft eventually .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception reception .
i guess you can see that there are many different types of cameras : all of the things that we &apos;ve been doing is a <unk> number of <unk> , a very large number of them all of us in that environment .
and if i can , i &apos;ll find some of the odd things .
many of you are covered by faces .
somewhere there are a set of photographs -- there are them .
this is actually a poster of notre dame <unk> .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of that environment .
the point is that we can do things with the social environment , and now data data from all of us -- from all of collective collective memories of how , visually , the earth -- and everything is connected .
all of these pictures are going to be interconnected and it creates something larger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of the entire earth .
think of this as the sequel of the process of stephen <unk> at virtual earth .
and this is something that is through the complexity that people use it , and it uses the benefit of the users with the application with the application .
their own photos are collected with data with <unk> , which has one other person .
if any of the trouble has done and all that lie to all of them and tells you who you all are , then my photograph will be <unk> with all this data , and i can use them to be able to use it to start out in this room , to bring it out of other parts of the world with different parts of the experience .
and of course , byproduct is all of the immense virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that doesn &apos;t just get through <unk> or satellite images and so forth , but through collective memory .
thank you .
am i understanding it right ? your software allows for a certain point , within the next few years , all the images that are used in someone in the world , are essentially being connected ?
yeah . she does not discover anything else .
if you want to create <unk> between them .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the abundance of the information that have a lot of these pictures .
how do you conduct a <unk> for images where you put in sentences , and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what this is .
but what if the image was connecting them to all of these images ?
then the amount of <unk> <unk> and the abundance , which it makes , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , this is really incredible . thank you .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things out of my book , like i hope , in unison with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make some of some connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed this .
i want to start with what i call no dictionary .
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all of the western industrialized societies .
the official <unk> works , if our goal is to maximize the good good of our citizens , this is all about <unk> by the freedom of freedom .
the reason for that is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , worthwhile , for a human premise of human .
when people have freedom , each of us are for ourselves to do things that enhances our good welfare , and nobody has to vote for us .
embracing the freedom to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more good they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that it would not make sense to it .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us progress .
this is my supermarket , not a big one .
i just want to say something about <unk> .
there are the <unk> in the supermarket in my supermarket if you don &apos;t buy the extra different <unk> , and 12 <unk> you buy them to make a large number of <unk> <unk> , in unlikely unlikely case , no one in the store you have right in the store for it .
so this is like the supermarket .
and then you go to the <unk> store for a stereo stereo -- speakers , <unk> , radio , <unk> , and in a <unk> store there is so many <unk> facilities .
we can provide <unk> million different kinds of <unk> facilities together in the components that are offered to that business .
you have to admit that this is a great selection .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , there was any telephone on the phone that you wanted to get from the bell .
they rented her phone . they didn &apos;t buy it . <unk> .
a consequence of that was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen this up in your business , you can be sure it will be soon .
and what it does is it brings people to work in business and ask this question .
do you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are much more <unk> than the purchase of objects , the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you &apos;re going to go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor tells you that we could do a , or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risk .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and you say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risk and wind has those benefits and risk .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were a doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
the result is -- we call it <unk> : &quot; autonomy autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift is giving a decision of making a sense of choice , to someone who knows nothing , and even the best constitution is to make a choice -- is the patient .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing marketing for people like it , and me , that , if you think about it , don &apos;t make any sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why does it advertise to us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you &apos;ll expect to give us a doctor in the next morning to ask a change in the prescription .
something like this is just like our identity as a question of choice , like this slide show .
we don &apos;t have identity , we invent it .
and we &apos;re reinventing ourselves as much as we want .
that means that every day you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what to do for a kind of person you want to be .
in relation to marriage and family , there was a time when the <unk> was almost almost one one , and they were able to get them as fast as they could , and then they had children as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when and not what they did .
it &apos;s all easy to do .
i teach beautiful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less clever , and they &apos;re less <unk> .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy dealing with other things , they ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married ?
should i marry you ? should i have children , do it only ?
they &apos;re all <unk> .
and you will answer these questions , whether that means to do all the tasks that i give you and don &apos;t get a good grade in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to be more important .
work -- we &apos;ve been blessed to see carl carl , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every day on the planet -- until the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s actually a corner , from the way i &apos;m not going to tell you about the <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is this incredible freedom of choice we have to make things in time , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can watch our kids at football , and we have our cell phone to a hip , and our blackberry at other other , and our laptop probably landed on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all removed , every minute in which we have our <unk> , <unk> <unk> , we ask ourselves , &quot; should i give this call call this call ?
should i answer that letter ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is it &apos;s affecting their experience of their child &apos;s lives differently than it was .
wherever we look , big things and small things , tangible things and lifestyle , life is a matter of choice .
and the world that we lived in was the way .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not all was a matter of choice .
and the world that we now live in now looks like .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices are two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , a wise way , is that he <unk> <unk> .
so , with so many options that you can choose , it will be very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of an example , a study of investing in volunteer in <unk> .
one colleague of mine had access to <unk> of <unk> , the gigantic <unk> of about a million people , and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a <unk> member of the employer , taking an participation from two percent .
they offer 50 percent less employees at 10 percent less than employees would be part of their own . why ?
because there are 50 years who are choosing choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose to take it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , then tomorrow morning and tomorrow , and tomorrow , it never comes .
understand that that doesn &apos;t just mean that people eat food food when they go to <unk> , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go , it makes them make a lot of decisions that they &apos;re missing out of their employers .
it doesn &apos;t give participation , to 5,000 dollars a year on the <unk> that were happy to reproduce their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of many options .
and i think it &apos;s the idea that the world looks like this .
you want to really make the decision really if it is for eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to be the wrong investment fund , or <unk> the wrong .
so that &apos;s the effect . the other thing is that even though we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end less happy with the outcome of choice , when we had the opportunity to choose between less choices .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is increasing by the great choice of different <unk> , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , what is <unk> is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that they would have better .
the more ways there is , the more easy to regret that i think is a disappointing for you .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert made a great point of this morning by telling us how much of what we evaluate things , depends on what we compare it .
well , if there are lots of alternatives to think , it &apos;s easy to imagine alternate ways to imagine the alternatives that they exclude , they make less satisfaction with the alternative they voted for .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who don &apos;t have new yorkers , i apologize .
but here is what they should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of them on the hamptons .
very expensive stuff .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
what might be better ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man &quot; thinks , &quot; it is august .
everyone in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks after that thought that he has missed the possibility of having a great parking lot .
<unk> <unk> down the satisfaction that we get through our selection , even if we &apos;ve chosen to be fantastic .
and the more opportunities for choice , the more attractive features of that choice are given into consideration .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon makes some statements .
he &apos;s going to make a statement about that now and to do things slowly .
but a big point of which he is doing : whenever you choose to decide , you don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have lots of alternative traits , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re doing is going to do less attractive .
third , <unk> of expectations .
this struck me when i wanted to share my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was just a kind of <unk> , and they &apos;d bought them , and they were <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they carried them long enough , they had started to go .
so , for example , i went to buy new jeans after many years old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans here , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sales said , &quot; do you want <unk> , <unk> <unk> ?
do you want to put buttons or <unk> ? stone or <unk> ?
do you want to be jeans with holes ?
if you want to cut it far , <unk> , blah blah blah , &quot; and so on , he said .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered recovered , i would like to have the only way i used to be . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour so everybody would take this damn <unk> jeans , and i &apos;m going to say the truth -- and i say the truth -- with the best google jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had better . all that selection allowed me to make it better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it .
the reason i was feeling worse was , with all of the available possibilities , my expectations for what a good pair of jeans was going up .
i had very low expectations . i had no point of them , as it was just in one way .
when they got in 100 ways , it was doomed .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so compared to what i had received what i expected , and what i had was disappointing to what i expected .
adding adding to the people in the people &apos;s lives , the expectations have people have to be good about how good these things are .
and that leads to less satisfaction with the results , even if the results are good .
no one in the world of <unk> knows this . because if they would , they didn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that used to do was better than anything was worse , as it was worse , it was possible for people to be experiences in some ways .
now , in the world that we live in -- we are wealthy , <unk> citizens , perfection with perfection as a expectation -- the best one you can ever hope is things like this is what you expect .
they will never be comfortable with their responsibilities because their expectations , my expectations are <unk> .
the secret to <unk> -- this is what they &apos;ve all come from -- the secret to <unk> is low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t make it better . i didn &apos;t get myself .
but <unk> isn &apos;t always a bad thing .
finally , a <unk> of a <unk> sitting on a <unk> sitting on the middle of a little bit , if they &apos;re dissatisfied , and ask yourself why , who is responsible , the world is responsible . what would you do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one of the disappointing , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is , you know .
they could have better do it .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse me .
and so , when people make decisions , and even the results of decisions are good , they feel frustrated about them , they &apos;re <unk> .
clinical depression exploded in the world &apos;s last generation .
i believe a <unk> -- not the only one , but an <unk> <unk> of this <unk> of depression , and even suicide , is that people have learned that they &apos;ve been <unk> , and then , if they have to be aware of these experiences , they think it &apos;s their fault .
and so the <unk> is that it &apos;s generally better for us , objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> , which we think is all right , is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there is no question that &apos;s a better choice than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choice is better than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve lost this point to the <unk> of our public welfare .
now , as a policy question -- i &apos;m nearly done -- as a policy question , the thing that &apos;s all allowed to think about is what these choices are in the developed societies , is the material that is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them that are not a big choice .
the problem is they have too little .
so the things that i talk about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and annoying is , steve <unk> told her how much more expensive and difficult to make car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to do it .
they even hurt .
they worry about the worse .
if something that contributed to the people in our society , the choices that people would have led to the <unk> of societies , would not only affect people &apos;s lives , but our way would be improved .
economists call this an <unk> application .
<unk> is going to worry about it all better -- not just the poor -- because all these great choices are <unk> us .
finally , read the cartoon , and , beautifully <unk> , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish ?
you don &apos;t know anything about this . &quot;
<unk> fantasy , a <unk> view of the world -- and that is the way i read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i came up with the view that fish fish .
because the truth is that if you break the ice cream , so that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis .
if you break the ice cream , so it &apos;s possible , you get your satisfaction down .
they increase the paralysis , down the <unk> .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost limited to perfect security -- potentially the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> is a <unk> metaphor for a misery , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before the human genome and what it could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , starting from a new point : we &apos;ve got the digital digitization , and now we &apos;re trying to get the digital code in a new phase of the biology , creating new life and building .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i believe that many biologists have tried to understand , and it &apos;s based on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it up to the minimum components .
we have been nearly 20 years ago , when we sequenced the <unk> sequenced the shift from analog analog to the digital world of the digital world .
now , let &apos;s try to ask whether we can regenerate , or can we make new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , <unk> bacterium , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do it with a smaller yet genome .
we &apos;ve managed to give up about a hundred genes to the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our comparison . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we can eliminate all of these genes , it &apos;s very unlikely that would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to synthesize that chromosome , so that allows us to vary the individual components , so we can ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
does it really allow these chemistry to make these really big molecules that never been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we do the chromosome ?
one chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps at the <unk> of life has been exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , but still our final point now to put on an exponential curve now .
we started this 15 years ago .
it took me a few years starting with a financial review before we did the first experiments .
and it turns out that it &apos;s very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of things around the world that can make these little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make one piece , the more <unk> .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces together and make mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with digital data , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus of killing bacteria .
we made small bits , made a <unk> and had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and put it into a bacteria and the bacteria started to read the genetic code , and made a difference in viral particles .
the gene particles then come out of the cells and then come back and killed e. coli .
recently , i talked about the oil industry , and they said she was able to do this model .
they laughed more than they did .
so we think that this is a situation where software actually can build the hardware , in a biological system .
but we wanted to go a little bit further . we wanted to build an entire <unk> chromosome , and so it was more than the <unk> code , so we thought , we made it out of the size of the cassette , to be able to understand what the individuals are the components of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital digital in the computer , this digital information needs to be accurate .
when we sequenced the genome back in 1995 we had the <unk> in a <unk> chromosome .
we found in the unfortunate 30 years . if we had used the <unk> sequence , it would never be possible .
part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 times long , and they have to overlap with other pieces of pieces to form smaller pieces so that they fit together .
we have embedded with some unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve got <unk> .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t.
<unk> of these letters -- these letters <unk> about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single single choice for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
initially , we just signed .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
we built the pieces so that we could just break them down with enzymes enzymes , and then we can put these <unk> and bring it together .
and we started to create chunks , starting with the number five to <unk> letters , put these together to each other , to put these together again , to <unk> them together .
in each one , we &apos;ve made these pieces in the surplus to be able to sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process to create what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get the <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
when we get to these very large pieces -- with a <unk> base -- they &apos;re not going to grow in e. coli -- it &apos;s just beyond all the technology of modern molecular biology , and so we applied to other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of the <unk> <unk> called the biology of order to repair dna to bring these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this : there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million rads of radiation .
you can see in the upper field that the chromosome is falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , it brought together once again as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be dried up , they can actually live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life can exist in space and move , looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- in fact , we only use <unk> using the right design of the pieces that we put it in . it adds automatically <unk> .
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
these are photos over six seconds .
this is the evidence that we &apos;ve just recently completed .
these are over the <unk> of <unk> code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that has ever created by humans .
it &apos;s got 300 million of them .
if we print it with a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , it would be <unk> pages , just about these genetic code .
well , how do we do a chromosome ? how are we activate ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus ; it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier to do it in the middle of the way we do it : you just take the nucleus out , and there &apos;s another one , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about .
in fact , the chromosome in the cell is actually embedded in the cell , but we &apos;ve shown that you can take a complete transplant transplant from a cell to another , and that can activate .
we found the chromosome of a pair of neurons -- roughly speaking of these two times as humans , and mice , and we gave some chromosome to do this chromosome , and it was very surprising to us all the protein .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to bring that further .
this is the evolution of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here that have taken a second chromosome or a third of <unk> , each time thousands of features in just one second to a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene has changed a time that has changed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes that are enzymes called the <unk> , in fact that they actually digest .
the chromosome that in the cell has no ; the chromosomes we have in it .
it was <unk> in the cell and the other chromosome as a foreign material , and then we had only a cell with a new chromosome .
it had blue blue because of the genes that we put in it .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and completely <unk> on a new species based on the new software that we had given in the cell .
all the proteins changed their membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve gone .
it might be like genomic species , but we can move by changing the <unk> , things are dramatically dramatic .
now , i argued that this is not the <unk> -- this is based on 3.5 billion years ago .
and i &apos;ve argued that we may be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there could be a new new <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious about what we need .
we &apos;re back to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in 1960 .
today , three people on this planet for each one has existed since year since &apos; 90s , within 40 years , they will be four .
we have problems with food , safe water , safe water , medicine for the <unk> billion people .
it becomes a challenge for the nine .
we need five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels of water . this is a hundred million <unk> per day .
if we think about biological processes or the process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 of this material that goes into the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries from the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re hitting the lines of the biological reality and the ones that we see .
we &apos;re now technologies today to do what we call the genetics genetics .
so we &apos;ve got the opportunity to build a large robot to build the millions of chromosomes a day .
if you look at these 20 million different genes , or to try to optimize those processes to create <unk> or drugs that we can do with a small group of molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can go to <unk> <unk> , production from chemicals or <unk> <unk> and so forth .
this is a photograph of actual <unk> that we &apos;re working on , and then you &apos;re actually designing new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it looks like . we know exactly what the genetic code looks like .
we &apos;re focusing on fuels in the fourth generation .
you have recently seen corn ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have the <unk> of <unk> and third generation , and the third generation is going to come up with much more <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way that biology has a huge impact on the cost of food or the supply of their availability is , when we see co2 as the source , and so we work on cells that go away .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of <unk> &apos;s fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and the co2 are a way .
but -- in our discoveries in the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism that we have described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , in <unk> <unk> .
it elevates co2 into methane , under the use of hydrogen than the source of hydrogen .
we study whether we can use co2 emissions , which can be brought into <unk> , which is the co2 in the fuel to power this process .
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we have really -- <unk> goals like the substitute of all the industrial industry . right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? or what ?
but the same thing we &apos;re working on is working on the same model for developing vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen it this year with flu , we &apos;re all over a year , and you have a dollar a little bit if it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s going to be changed by using <unk> <unk> .
this is what the future might look like with changes , and today can be accelerating today , with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , <unk> and perhaps <unk> .
we are making light years from making people better , and our goal is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to do this . maybe thank you .
at the last ted conference , i had a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how this machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all of those who haven &apos;t been there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment which we &apos;ve ever been addressed , and 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that are less than a half of the universe at the beginning of the universe -- and to 600 million times within the second .
it &apos;s just just wonderfully ambitious .
this is the machine below the geneva .
we take pictures of these panels on detectors .
this is what i work on . this is what we call a atlas detector -- 44 meters in diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas of building that you &apos;re looking at the scale .
on the 10th of the last year , the machine was first for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
you have huge impact in the control room room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first computer that <unk> the entire distance around the lhc , then to turn to a part of the lhc , to capture a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this could generate the largest <unk> , or this , when somebody went to the google site and the front page looked .
it means that we have a cultural impact on the scientific level .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to be related to these things -- these golden wires here here .
these are <unk> wires , when the machine runs on <unk> .
now , the engineers you &apos;re looking at them and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do that . these are little wires . &quot;
you can do that because you heat it down a so-called <unk> .
so at minus <unk> , cooler than the space between the stars , these are the tension of the friction .
in one of the connections between the <unk> magnet at the lhc , there was a <unk> .
by heat the wires apart and <unk> <unk> <unk> suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , that &apos;s an amazing thing , if you think that the magnets over 20 pounds is to move to about 30 centimeters .
so , we damaged about 50 of magnets .
and they had to take away what we did .
we redefined them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back to her way .
at march end , the lhc will be <unk> .
we will turn it up and expect the first data on june or june , and we can track our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in such forms of these kinds of accidents , the debate about the value of science and <unk> of boundaries , it &apos;s easy to reject it .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard is the fact that we move beyond our limitations , creating the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my favorite words in english english , <unk> <unk> , who , as i guess when he was the <unk> of his <unk> , his apprentice was michael <unk> , saying , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind .
thank you .
i am a writer .
writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my love , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect the going to change .
now , the recent thing that i have done in my life and my career that has led me to rethink my relationship to this particular thing .
this curious event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> -- that , in fact , different than all of my previous books , in europe -- and a large <unk> , <unk> international <unk> .
the result is that i don &apos;t matter where i get to treated , as if i get to the extinction .
seriously , extinction -- <unk> .
for example , they &apos;re always concerned with me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you know you &apos;re going to never beat that success ?
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;ve prepared your entire life and never bring out a book that anyone in the world ? whether you never ?
okay , that &apos;s really the courage .
but it would be worse , if i didn &apos;t remember that , over 20 years ago , when i was a teenager , told me that i wanted to be a writer by being the same kind of <unk> reaction .
people said , &quot; don &apos;t have you afraid to never succeed ?
don &apos;t you afraid you kill the humiliation of a child ?
do you have no fear that you &apos;ve made this life for your life and never get into something that you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> dream -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ? <unk> <unk> ?
this is like , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : <unk> yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things .
and i always had .
and i have a lot more of things that nobody would ever see .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but , for writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently recently .
is that reasonable ?
is it obvious that somebody should be afraid that he &apos;s afraid to do the job he &apos;s <unk> ?
and what &apos;s really about doing the creative enterprises do is that they make us uncertain about the other physical condition -- in a way that the other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , chemist and i can &apos;t remember the situation in the 40 years as a chemist if he was afraid to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how are you doing it ?
it didn &apos;t just happen , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have talked about the centuries of <unk> <unk> people .
we also seem to be a kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but the creative of all these days , they seem to be felt powerful , being incredibly unlikely .
everything that you need to do is to shake the bitter <unk> of the really great minds from the 20th century , young young lives .
and even the ones that don &apos;t actually committed <unk> , seemed to be neglected to their <unk> .
norman <unk> said shortly before his death in his last interview : <unk> each of my books got me down a little bit .
one extraordinary message they can do about their own life .
but we don &apos;t even see if we hear somebody say something like this , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of statements since so long , somehow we have the notion that creativity and suffering are kind of <unk> of creativity and suffering -- and always the art -- always leads to <unk> .
the question i want to ask today to you is this idea of being perfectly fine ?
do you feel that ? because with just one centimeter distance , i see , i don &apos;t feel that i don &apos;t think of that .
i find them <unk> .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how she &apos;s taken over the next century .
i find it better if we encourage our great creative ideas .
and i know it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous -- to be able to begin with this dark path of some sense , <unk> -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right now .
that is -- you see : i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have 40 other moments of mine in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything that i &apos;m going to write from now is from the world that &apos;s been judged by the final success of my last book , right ?
i say it <unk> because we &apos;re all kind of friends now here -- it &apos;s probably probably that my biggest achievement is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thought that you can get someone to start to get at 4 a.m. in the morning , gin , and i don &apos;t want that .
i would rather continue to do this work i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of <unk> , i seem to be able to write about making some kind of psychological psychological constructed .
somehow , i have to find some way to find out a <unk> distance between me and my very natural <unk> of how it responds to the writing .
as i &apos;ve been looking for models for models for what i &apos;ve been looking for , i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies , and see how you could help creative creativity , to cope with the emotional risks associated with creativity .
this quest led me to greece and the old rome .
please ask me , because the circle will come back .
but in ancient ancient and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity of people comes out , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> that came from a distant , unknown source of people -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this divine <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
now , it &apos;s known to socrates that he believed he had a <unk> that he would tell him a distance .
the romans had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative spirit of <unk> art .
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really realize that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical , <unk> creatures that it was literally <unk> in the walls of a <unk> -- sort of like <unk> , the <unk> and the artist , working with the <unk> , and <unk> the outcome .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance i &apos;m talking about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the effects of your work .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
the artist of <unk> was some sense of protected , like , for example , too <unk> , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you could not look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this <unk> genius that helped her .
when your work <unk> -- not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew your genius was slightly <unk> .
so people in the west really thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came and changed , and we had this big idea . and this great idea was : let me give the human individual in the center of the universe -- all the gods and mystery , and there is no room for mystic creatures that <unk> actions .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity completely changed from its own individual .
for the first time in history , people hears this or an artist to call this genius , rather than that he &apos;s a genius .
i have to tell you , i think it was a big mistake .
you know ? i think of a mere person that he thinks he &apos;s or she &apos;s like the <unk> , like the basins and the essence , the <unk> and the source of all divine , the <unk> basins , a whole little bit of responsibility , to <unk> a <unk> of human psychology .
it &apos;s like to ask somebody to swallow the sun .
this is <unk> and distorted whole ego , and it generates all these <unk> expectations of success .
i think this one of these <unk> is our <unk> last year .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps to a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t have rational <unk> for <unk> <unk> , not simply watching an <unk> talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who will really conceive of doubt <unk> about the notion of what -- basically , <unk> people , <unk> and <unk> on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to address is why not ?
why not so that think ?
because it does as much sense of everything else that i &apos;ve heard of when it came to explain the whole crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that -- as everybody knows who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody -- doesn &apos;t always sensible .
in fact , it can sometimes feel more frightening .
i had a close encounter recently , when i met the extraordinary american poet stone , which is now over 90 percent , but she was a poet poet , who was working on the fields . she said she would feel and hear about a poem about the landscape on them .
she said it would be like a <unk> train .
the land was going to <unk> .
she felt when it came in , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew she could only be able to do that for a moment , and that was -- in their words -- <unk> <unk> like the devil .
she ran up like the devil , when she was haunted by this poem , it was just about that they quickly had to go quickly to a sheet of paper and a pencil , so that it would allow you to capture and capture it on the sheet .
again , they weren &apos;t fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , and she got to the house , and she would get the paper , she said , &quot; she said , &quot; she said , &quot; she said , &quot; she would go on to a different poet . &quot;
and then there was these moments -- i &apos;m never going to forget -- she said that there were moments in which she missed it .
so , she &apos;s going to the house , and she searches for the paper , and the poem goes through her and she reaches a pencil just as it goes through them and then -- she said -- it was like that , and then they get it .
she caught the poem on his tail and pulled it back into her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
at that occasion , the poem came back and intact on the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first one .
when i heard that , i thought this is an amazing thing -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going on .
it &apos;s not like my creative process . i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a <unk> . and to work , i have to stand up every day at the same time and sweat , <unk> me and really uncomfortable .
but even in my <unk> , i &apos;ve got this thing up .
and i guess that many of you have done this .
even i &apos;ve been working , or ideas that come from a source through me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this thing ?
and how are we going to do that with our minds without losing our minds , but we even think of ourselves in intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example is how you can create the musician tom <unk> , and i allowed him to interview for a couple years ago .
we talked about this issue , and you know what ? most of his life was tom &apos;s embodiment of the modern modern <unk> , who was trying to master these creative creative impulses who lived in and to cope with them .
but then he got older and more quiet . he told me that one day went on a freeway freeway , and it changed everything .
he was driving at high speed , as he suddenly suddenly hear a little fragment of a melody that seems to be <unk> for him <unk> , and he wants them . she &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so it starts out , this old lady of him standing up with him , like , &quot; how am i going to lose this thing and will be haunted by this song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not able to make it .
but instead of getting panic , it just stopped .
and he stopped the whole thought , and she did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky , and he said , &quot; sorry , can you see that i &apos;m driving cars ? &quot;
so <unk> are i looking at a song ?
if you really want to exist , come up to a <unk> moment when i can take care of you .
if not , somebody else does anyone else .
go and <unk> cohen cohen .
his whole family has changed .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as long as ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that surrounds him , it declined because he made the genius out of where he had nothing of trouble when they were coming into it .
it could be a <unk> , wondrous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and <unk> , it &apos;s not something tom &apos;s .
when i heard this story , it also changed a bit like the work i worked , and it has saved me .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , and i fell in one of those <unk> of the <unk> , and when we work on it , and it doesn &apos;t work . you start to think that it &apos;s a disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i was going to think about the project .
but then i remembered how tom was in the free sky , and i tried it .
so i took my view of the manuscript , and i was talking about my empty corner of the room .
i spoke loudly , <unk> , you know , you know , if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see , i guess everything i have , invest . i have no longer than that .
so if you want to make it better , you have to keep up here and push your stake .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do -- you know what , the hell of it .
i &apos;m going to write further , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you my record , that i &apos;ve been here for part of the jobs here .
because -- in the end , it &apos;s like this , and centuries ago in the <unk> of people , <unk> <unk> people with <unk> dances with music that were hours of time until the dawn of dawn .
these <unk> were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something really happened , one of the performers was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen in such a performance of your life .
it was like the time of <unk> and the dancers through a kind of <unk> <unk> , and he did nothing different than he ever did -- a thousand before before , but all together , together .
and all of a sudden he no longer appeared to be human .
it was lit up inside and inside of the bottom , and everything lit through a <unk> fire .
when something happened , the people that was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together , and they started singing , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god .
this is god , you know ?
interesting historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> came into this practice , and the <unk> changed the centuries of <unk> centuries , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you still hear about <unk> and <unk> .
if a performer in spain has something something , it &apos;s done something , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancer wakes himself up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 on a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a <unk> of god in it .
he &apos;s merely a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knees , and maybe it will never come up and down again .
and maybe nobody will call again god &apos;s name when he turns , but what do he do to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the <unk> of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> unless they believed in the beginning of the most extraordinary aspects of their existence .
if you just believe that they &apos;re a loan -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> of time , or somebody &apos;s passed on to another person when they &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think about security in the past month , while i was working on the book that will soon seem -- when the dangerous , frightening , strong expecting strongly been my final success .
what i constantly need to say , when i &apos;m crazy about it , is not a fear .
don &apos;t be <unk> .
just do your job .
stay on your contribution to whatever it is .
if your job is a dance , dance .
if the silly divine genius , you &apos;re asking you to the site , decides for a brief moment of a sudden you can show up a breath of miracles through your effort , <unk> <unk> ! <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and if not , dance dance to your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you all of that .
i believe , and i feel that we should be teaching .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you all the very , very easy for you , the mere human love and the <unk> to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate the fact that the arctic sea had lived in nearly three million years , the size of the lower 48 states , which 40 percent shrunk .
but this doesn &apos;t make very strong enough of the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic is the beating heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in winter and <unk> .
so the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is labeled with red .
as you can see , it grows on the <unk> . this is the annual ice in winter , and it &apos;s increasing in summer .
this so-called <unk> , five years old , and it &apos;s almost like blood , which is out of the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone here here .
this is a problem because the warming is frozen the melting of the arctic ocean , where there are large quantities of <unk> carbon , which is , when it &apos;s occurring <unk> by methane , methane .
so compared to the amount of inert materials in the atmosphere , it &apos;s going to double the amount of time when we cross this critical point .
already , in some flat lakes today , we have methane methane from themselves from the water .
professor <unk> walter university of alaska has joined the university with another group of the shallow sea last year .
wow !
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how will it be <unk> .
and one reason is this massive heat warmer in the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in the greenland .
if you want to know , the rise of sea levels are rising up into the ocean .
these rivers are <unk> .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest <unk> are on the planet .
last month , researchers announced that the entire continent has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that has shown over some couple of <unk> is a very big place to melt .
this is equivalent to 20 feet , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , look at the lakes of a few years ago .
forty percent of all the people in the world get half of their <unk> out of this <unk> .
in the andes , these glaciers are the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> has been expanding .
but when they &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s also the most drinking water .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the coast of the sierra leone .
this is <unk> .
and the predictions of how you read it are seriously .
this <unk> in the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and disasters have been around in the world in a really <unk> and unprecedented species .
four times in the last 30 years , like <unk> .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve been 70 million tons of co2 , 25 hours of tons every day in the ocean .
look at the area of the eastern pacific right , from the american continent west and <unk> of the indian <unk> , where there is a decline in the sea .
most biggest factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was to build many more <unk> .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
here are the ones that went out in the last few years with some green alternatives that were proposed .
<unk> is there a political debate in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> <unk> last year to get clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
christmas week , at home , in my home in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
you saw it in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> <unk> america .
this happened all christmas .
one of the commercials at <unk> was the christmas one .
<unk> &apos;s <unk> is a <unk> , happy fellow .
it &apos;s in the shell and abundance in america , and it helps us grow to our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> is going to be clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers are living in <unk> and bread .
this is the source of the coal in the virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you a little clear . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so , the alliance for climate change two campaigns started .
this is one , one part of it .
we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
and so we put it up to the top of the <unk> , to have a lot of <unk> , to put a <unk> in the way to get the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it also smells good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s just leave that for us .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of these modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean .
and yet , burning of coal , one of the main reasons for global warming is the great clean ice sheets that you see here , changes everything .
look at it , this is what we are today , clean clean energy .
finally , the positive alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the <unk> threads that <unk> all of them is our dependence on <unk> fuels like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to make us free ourselves from this <unk> situation .
<unk> <unk> : 60 percent electricity electricity in the next 10 years
a plan to bring us back to work , make us safer and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america <unk> . find out more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , dirty fuels , the world in our world .
the future is here , wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create well <unk> jobs .
<unk> america , new time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african <unk> saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come in , go together . &quot;
we &apos;ve got to get far ahead and fast .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to go to the time of your childhood , when you played with <unk> .
as they realized , how to raise the hands and <unk> the <unk> , and they actually learned how to understand and understand problems through understanding and understanding the profound nature .
the spatial thinking is very tightly connected to how we understand most of our surroundings .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of interaction with our real objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> and my colleague , <unk> , i started to wonder : what would be if we could intervene in both of these hands and data to organize the physical way that we want ?
and this question was really so important that we decided to explore the answer of the answer and developed .
in short , a <unk> computer is a interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move through the hand , you can see each other , you can grasp your movements , and you have a screen and a <unk> .
more importantly , are you physically , as you can reach out how to reach out of your hands through your hands .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> interfaces the digital data .
and when these are the physical forces , and they have an awareness of their movements , they can recognize each other and see the other features of us with them , then we can begin to explore and explore with new exploration and <unk> .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is for <unk> <unk> , and when i turn it into a direction , the video is going to play , when i flip it into the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits are each other .
so , if i put them side-by-side , you get your interest .
when they &apos;re surrounded by , they &apos;ll notice that and then they get something nervous .
and they feel like their movements and <unk> .
so , an interesting implication of the interactions that we started to realize is that we could use everyday gestures on the way , like putting it in the way that you do with the liquids .
in this case , we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to cast color in the center in the middle , where they &apos;re going to be blended together .
if we overdo it , we can <unk> a little bit .
there are also some nice ways in education like <unk> , mathematics or <unk> , where we give people the possibility of fast and error and to see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m using a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words that is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you get each round of every month of random <unk> , and while you &apos;re trying to form words , they &apos;re an <unk> .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , mixed again and then have a new <unk> and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some of the kids that came to a media lab to me , and i could drive them , and i took a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact in this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; takes words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest , <unk> <unk> down there .
it turned out he was just buying <unk> .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop an investment model for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by <unk> the <unk> from the table from the table .
this is how he leaves the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he brings a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the <unk> shaking , and he puts them side-by-side , he can make the characters ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open ends , and it can decide how to evolve .
flying cat .
the last example i have time today to show it is to be a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the <unk> as a sound , <unk> , bass , onstage .
each has four different variations . you can select which you want to use .
and you can fold this sound into the sequence that you can , can be able to organize in any pattern .
and you put them in a way by holding a <unk> to a <unk> .
there are effects that you can live live , like <unk> and filter .
you combine it with a certain sound , and it tends to employ it .
and then the same effects of speed and volume that you get on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start to put the <unk> in two <unk> and put them in a row , and extend , to a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now , i &apos;m going to do some tiles here .
and now i can combine the filter with the drums so that i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the entire sequence by accelerating the pace of a different direction .
and now i &apos;m just combining the filter with the bass , for some more expression .
i can change the sequence while it &apos;s changing .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan them in advance , but they can improvise them to <unk> or <unk> them .
and finally , i can <unk> the entire sequence by touching the <unk> .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire to develop new <unk> , the better shape of how our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to give you a part of this new <unk> and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i &apos;d like to give you with the way is that we &apos;re on the verge of this new generation of <unk> to the digital media with the digital media , bringing information into our world .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversation with you all .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m very excited that i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what is supposed to be <unk> ?
i just have to step back a little bit , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> with the modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been working on the lab for a couple of years , and that &apos;s how i just wanted to know more , and i wanted to know what i could do in studying study so much .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter of it , like that .
i think that molecular biology is generally universal , so we &apos;re talking about biotechnology , everything that is important to synthetic biology and so on .
crucially , it &apos;s crucially extremely important , and more importantly , is going to become much more important in the future .
there are so controversial that all these <unk> genetically modified plants to the <unk> .
we now have craig venter in the <unk> who &apos;s trying to make <unk> , which is gas from algae .
there are already things that are really involved in the everyday life , most of the people , but not consciously consciously , for example , that allow us to wash up 60 degrees of <unk> , are also <unk> enzymes .
and the list can continue on .
and so , from interest in this technology , i &apos;m just moved on there anymore .
so what &apos;s <unk> now ?
most people know this from the <unk> .
computers hack , and then it changes in media with me , yes , the hackers are <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of a terrible thing to be quite sad because it &apos;s not really what it actually started , and what it actually is .
and in fact , the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s also created the internet .
and it &apos;s about combining play , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and the problem , this is not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a <unk> thing , which means how things simplify , whatever you can do , or how can you do that .
and it &apos;s been done with software , but there &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole bunch of <unk> that can do all kinds of things that are doing things .
and now , in addition to biology , and i want to be this metaphor that &apos;s coming from synthetic biology , which is actually biology is actually a <unk> code , because it &apos;s more matter , because matter is real matter , and not just <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also use it , and you can also hack it , so i found it incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get much deeper into this .
this actually has actually really raised eight <unk> to these kinds of networks .
there is <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is linked to europe and with cooperation in india , and now , members and active people around the world .
that &apos;s what &apos;s got an artistic arts orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers working in collaboration with scientists working with these kinds of issues and asking them to be creative , and there &apos;s all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s always about trying to have an opportunity access to having an effective way of dealing with the playful .
and then there are <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is out of the network of a network , which is actually a kind of forum where you go and you go online online .
they &apos;re a little bit of technical technical , and it &apos;s a little bit more <unk> , and then they &apos;re also waiting to ask yourself .
and according to these networks that the whole popular effect , it took place to be a scene that i would soon want to go on .
in here , on the left , you see <unk> , which is a <unk> , so basically a kind of school , a private school , a nonprofit institution where everybody can be .
children , old , all kinds of people going to go and get around with them , have a place in the lab and look at what can you do when they &apos;re doing this .
here on the left is a group in indonesia , called <unk> , who says , but there &apos;s quite a long time .
it &apos;s longer than these other two networks .
they &apos;re also concerned about the artistic aspect of biological materials , and , also , <unk> , and combine that in a pretty <unk> way .
a group of ankara that i &apos;ve ever met a while ago , who &apos;s got a <unk> that would like to talk about the public what they learn in college , and they &apos;ve tried to explain to you what <unk> is done .
and i put up in the other way , i have a lecture in copenhagen with a exhibition with a exhibition .
and that &apos;s , you know , it &apos;s mostly quite a young people , but the only thing which all one thing is collectively , this fascination with the technology .
and what you can do with that , and you can go on and focus on this society , and ask , &quot; ok , what do you know what you want to do with you ? &quot;
so , <unk> , now to hack biology , you need some material .
you need organic materials , but you need some tools , and then it &apos;s a laboratory .
and what you &apos;re normally talking about in a lab , these are kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely <unk> , <unk> <unk> , educated academics and <unk> .
and our approach was just saying , <unk> , that you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because each each every single <unk> has actually developed more technology than most <unk> , that &apos;s really like this .
and it &apos;s with my ultimate premise with this premise , for example , for example , <unk> <unk> in england , a <unk> <unk> , then he &apos;s taken a <unk> , a <unk> and <unk> , and then it turns out bacteria .
so every one that &apos;s once ago is a soup that he has left for a long time ago .
so i &apos;ve tried this in my lab to try and expand a little bit , and then you put it on ebay on ebay , and you &apos;re making a little <unk> analysis , so you can do a <unk> , so you can go back to home .
now that shouldn &apos;t be a joke at all .
so , in the bottom here , you can see the lab , in <unk> , so this is a <unk> garage , with all the <unk> lab , which has <unk> , a lot of interesting things , that i &apos;ve also wanted to do a project that &apos;s happening .
and this is <unk> , which is also mentioned <unk> , that &apos;s sort of , sort of <unk> , essentially for molecular biology .
and yes , you can see , it &apos;s relatively relatively small , so that &apos;s what we can do , so there are people from people who do it at home , to large big organizations that might be able to do this in more sophisticated ways .
but always always the approach that it &apos;s going to be easy and accessible .
the first project we did as an international group , when we were aware of ourselves ourselves , <unk> , we now have a real place here , and we are online , and we are familiar with people that are always chatting and so forth .
and then , by the <unk> <unk> , the founder of the founders , and said , <unk> , we really need to meet again and make real place , and then then two sets of events , in san francisco .
and , then there was also a <unk> , which is , who are we , what are we , what do we want to do , what do we want to ?
and what are our values and what are our objective , our foundation ?
and then we have this <unk> <unk> .
that was quite intuitive , so everyone has just like his wishes , his and whatever she moves .
there was , in my mind , a very good code .
and then we haven &apos;t prepared it , but that &apos;s definitely , i think , has done reasonably well , people are quite convinced of this .
and we then even tried it to rebuild the academic world again , but it &apos;s kind of kind of arrived there .
so i think we are from <unk> , in fact , even more than the <unk> world .
well , what are we going to do with projects right now ?
a project i did with the <unk> <unk> in switzerland , that we used a so-called <unk> , <unk> or optical <unk> .
this is when you &apos;re focused on a laser , in a room , in the room , and you can capture little particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then it &apos;s going to be in that sense , so that &apos;s kind of floating in the same way .
this really works , this is done in academic journals , and we thought , well , we might think we had the webcam , then the <unk> <unk> , then you have a microscope that expands up a <unk> .
this is what you see .
and then we put a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> the laser <unk> and then trying to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , unfortunately , didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it .
so another project that came from from the french group in paris , that worked out , and it &apos;s pretty cool .
and so he &apos;s kind of like this , like a <unk> , like <unk> , so something , so he &apos;s got involved with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
and then he built this this helmet and built in cooperation with the museum .
and then the visitors dragged into this room can go into this seat , sit on this chair .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought they were thinking , then there are different lights in the room .
it was a pretty pretty big project .
another thing from the united states , which has now to do with these <unk> , is the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , it &apos;s complicated , complicated word .
so it &apos;s all about copying genes , to reproduce , to replicate fragments , so that you can make it visible .
so , if i &apos;m going to do that the <unk> of the crime scene , they go to collect some <unk> , and then they do these kinds of work , and then they can say , &quot; well , this hair belongs to this human .
and the machines doing that , they &apos;re pretty expensive to buy commercial , the cheapest <unk> at the <unk> .
and that &apos;s not at <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that &apos;s also very much .
so this is just an application of a lot you can do with it .
and so you have these two two <unk> <unk> and said , <unk> , we make it easier and cheaper , and then you get it in open source , so you &apos;ve got the first <unk> , and now you &apos;ve got the cheapest <unk> of these devices worldwide .
i think it &apos;s about six hundred or something like this .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly in an area where you get it more .
so , i think it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project that i started recently ago was to build a <unk> .
<unk> is , like a kind of <unk> , which is about how far two inches or two .
you invite you to go to <unk> , and you <unk> into these <unk> , and then i took it to <unk> , and then i just bring it to light .
so the device that you see there is not working .
but this is like my prototype , which was pretty <unk> looked like that , so on a branch , this thing on the branch , electronics it and <unk> it , and that was the pressure , which was broken .
and then i took a <unk> and put it to it .
a <unk> , if you make the full power of water , there &apos;s enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s 40 years of <unk> bar like that .
and then you can speed up the particles very quickly , and then you get it in the onion .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euros , or something like this , <unk> around the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so this is the moment that &apos;s the moment of the scene of this scene , allowing you to increase this source of technology and also enhance the information , and that makes it larger , that more people can be engaged in there .
because , in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea about it and also a chance to make it really well .
because , if you read only about it , it &apos;s not like the same thing that you &apos;ve done it once , or you &apos;ve done it .
and i think technology is always more important in our modern societies .
and if you can make a better decision and you could make meaningful decisions in society , and you want to be allowed , and then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand it and to understand it .
and then the <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and citizen citizen .
so , you know , as a citizen , you &apos;re being able to bring yourself up with these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of <unk> .
these are the people who at least officially , on the website , <unk> website .
this is already a remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re represented in southeast asia .
i think that &apos;s because there are fewer people sitting in fact than exist .
so i know some of you who haven &apos;t .
and that &apos;s just the <unk> , the individual people .
in part , also , with these <unk> , so they put this place together .
and this is very at the beginning .
as it said , <unk> started it .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in boston was the first one .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , <unk> , who are represented everywhere .
and we hope that we &apos;ll also think of it as well as well as well as well connected , so that even more people can be involved .
and i would invite everybody to join this and also even trying to do this .
now it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curiosity and enough enough energy , you get there too .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hi .
how do we work ?
this is a question that makes me very , really , designer designer , but also in the area of <unk> and <unk> in the area of the world .
it &apos;s about how you encounter people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media , and they create a very immersive experience .
in fact , i think that the interactive media in our <unk> , cognitive models , <unk> model , is a paradigm that has been encoded in our biological memory , very long time , and that we can create them through virtual media .
and this is quite amazing , because you think that these <unk> , you think you &apos;re going to take a place in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s the idea that the future is right in us , in our <unk> roots .
so what are <unk> models now ?
i wrote down four <unk> , and i want to tell you a little bit about it .
to <unk> cognitive models , and these are the models that we &apos;ve done in the pre-industrial times .
and to these <unk> models , that we have a natural natural relationship to virtuality .
now , it doesn &apos;t seem unusual .
but i &apos;m going to go to the same way , and i &apos;ll just give you an attempt to prove that you have a natural relationship with virtuality .
the second aspect of this is that because of these <unk> models , we &apos;ve been able to speak very much very , very distinctive , even though we use a <unk> language .
and the third area , it turns out to itself itself .
we all know that the interactive media is definition by definition , which is the <unk> of linearity , and what obviously tells us is that linearity is normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place for the place .
now , how is this with the virtuality , which is actually the most dangerous thing in the world .
i want to tell you that .
how many doors have the house where they live ?
and we won &apos;t answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen in the moment , and it happens right now .
they go in the spirit of this house , in <unk> , and they look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they <unk> the reality and not with computers .
fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
and there &apos;s a lot of effort on the project to introduce the reality of our virtual reality system , so we can actually do this all the time .
and this <unk> wealth is transforming the reality that we have had to have people needed in the pre-industrial times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they had was their head .
and in that mind just passed .
in this head , knowledge and intelligence together , the virtual images , the imagination , was actually passed on knowledge .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so strong in us that we can <unk> with virtuality .
and the interesting thing about it is , if i can give a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s going .
the interesting thing about this is that this man was the same time and the medium itself .
now , if you think about a piece of it .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there was a change .
but i &apos;ll talk to that again .
and the primary tool of <unk> has ever been ever since ever known .
<unk> , priests , so-called <unk> , were ready to get extra <unk> to keep knowledge in stories .
and today , we are still very , very strong in stories .
the author of the book , the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , according to <unk> , we <unk> every year with <unk> stories .
that means for a child , for the time that the most of the rest of his life has spent most of his life with the <unk> of life .
now we think our love &apos;s stories depends on that we were sitting on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
this is much further back , in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
but to me , in the realm of interactive media as a remarkable , is that we have <unk> in our biological memory , the ability to think of skill .
i brought you an example of the american <unk> tribe .
and life lived in the columbia district of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you &apos;ve got to navigate somehow , up from the island of island to get food .
and they did this with something called <unk> <unk> .
you may know what if you &apos;re really interested in the american indians .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a <unk> , but they have used such as <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation system and the topography of regions can be captured .
where the language was <unk> by <unk> accents .
that means you &apos;re talking about sounds and <unk> .
and these sounds and this rhythm , geology is represented by the region of this region , and it also allowed to be able to put these songs together and interact differently , and they can move back into the left , and then again , to move back back .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from from a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually what happened ?
this is what &apos;s the <unk> machine age .
we &apos;ve moved on what &apos;s called <unk> .
you know , the machine age is happening , and it &apos;s going to happen , and this is what the book is happening .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened is that we &apos;re responsible for our memory and the memories of our individual memory shifted to the media .
so , on the book and the image .
so , unfortunately , of course , we have a little bit of <unk> <unk> .
virtuality has become strange alien to us , and has nothing to do with nothing of the reality .
bruce brown , a famous <unk> of <unk> , is so far left to say that this mass media , he says the book and the image , so not the television , and the web , etc . , etc . , etc .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
from the <unk> machine .
what determines our thinking and our <unk> ?
then the most diverse impacts of the ancient cultures .
and they are more and over the centuries , more and more <unk> through the influence of influence .
that means , instead of giving us individually , we spread it wide , very common patterns of memories that we can hang our personal memories .
we &apos;re not producing anymore .
we have a abstract language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing in images not to do things in images , but we <unk> them to speak .
we &apos;ve used to realize that things happen to happen .
and we have a rule of law , and there are only exceptions , like , for example , like <unk> .
what &apos;s left us is the <unk> .
still , we were the <unk> as a very , very , very , arrested .
the question is , what is happening ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the machine machine , and we &apos;re going to do this so-called <unk> .
that sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very detailed by science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of <unk> , these are bringing us back to these kinds of possibilities .
there &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about <unk> ; it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to tell you a little bit a little bit .
there are technical concepts like example , in terms of the <unk> reality , which is the augmented reality .
so if you look at google <unk> , for example , then the concept of which brings us to the virtual world with the real world , that means our <unk> to <unk> , to transform the virtual reality as a natural , natural awareness .
another example is the so-called reality reality .
so , of course , that sounds like , my name may sound , because we &apos;re physically moving together into <unk> , virtual worlds , to the most of the model of life .
and other other examples are the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that are smart to respond to people .
all of it needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
and i &apos;ve graduated , and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are also here today .
maybe you can get up a moment , so you can get up to the talk to the next talk about the project .
and this project , i brought along with these kinds of <unk> , cognitive models .
all this is a game , i have to say .
of course , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , is a computer game .
and when i say , computer games , you have very likely to see that people are <unk> people from any <unk> <unk> or they &apos;re playing with some type in their hand .
anyway , they &apos;re doing in this .
this is a game for it .
and this is specifically explicitly thinking that i discover the outside world , so that i discover the real world .
and so , this game connects the virtual world , so the data that the data that we produce , the world we create .
i apologize that i need to be so strong .
you can tell you a little bit better , so there &apos;s more more than that .
it &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at some places which are positive or negative .
and so i get a look at the city , and i see a very different impression , and i see the negatives and positive zones of a city , and i come up with this way , a map of a very real city .
and we can like to look at this .
ah , what you can see here , this is another little bit of what you &apos;re looking at .
of course , in the walls of our cities , it &apos;s clear .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i would love to sum up my talk , and in the sense that the characteristics and the skills that we &apos;ve made of the <unk> <unk> , and that we &apos;ve gone through a little bit more complex , the new things that we &apos;ve gone through .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to be with you .
i &apos;ve just been asked , whether this bag is a <unk> bag and i &apos;m going to talk about it .
it won &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m going to make a matter what happens in there .
but i &apos;ve just done it before , just a little bit curious .
yes , kids are inherently curious , or should be curious , like designers , designers .
i &apos;m a creator of <unk> , so i &apos;m an area of wonder , and i &apos;m also concerned with curiosity and curiosity about what makes us think , and why do we also want curiosity , and we need to suggest it and so forth .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re doing with your actual purpose as a creator .
if professors are going to be curious , they tend to go into something like a n <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half of the year .
a <unk> of the user interface interface design .
now you &apos;re going to ask , why are the whole <unk> of being involved with this natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interact and so on .
and i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices , because things are always more intuitive , and the more important people , and then you have to look at what &apos;s actually for us humans , which is <unk> or intuitive .
and before the background , i used to be an area of the natural natural interface , so the next generation of people , we have a computer computer , which means that our tools , or how the computers used to navigate the digital assistant .
so i &apos;m busy doing , when is of course or intuitively .
maybe you need to look at it again .
why does this happen ?
so , if we look at the evolution of our society , we &apos;re just going to see that we &apos;re going to move forward to the third one , or fourth of the <unk> .
so , from the modern ones .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning , the <unk> was talking about language .
that means you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked about a common language , you &apos;ve been able to communicate it , in the same cave , or in other places , cities have built , or towns and <unk> around the way that they create .
but the <unk> was the language , something very natural , something very living .
you also have to learn that , not a toddler can be speaking of nature , but we &apos;re learning it and <unk> .
and then that became implemented by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
now , this was a <unk> , because , of course , the language of the language began to <unk> in the form of writing , which means what <unk> and alive is alive , i &apos;ll start it in stone and <unk> it out .
the way after i <unk> , and when i <unk> , it &apos;s a very different story as if there is a living way , as a result of a life .
but <unk> , then that type of script turned out to be a <unk> .
then the next generation , which we actually live today are primarily primarily .
this is just by printing and <unk> <unk> script with <unk> and others .
at the time , it was like a <unk> , where the <unk> , <unk> and others said : are you really crazy when the people start reading , then they will still agree with it .
and now we &apos;re coming to the next generation , and the exciting one is just a couple of hundred years , and we &apos;re really in the moment at this moment , in this moment , that we &apos;ll get this kind of conversation .
and it confused by , of course , because we see on the side of the new media media , social social media , facebook and so on .
with the complete transparency , what the new thinking is , what you &apos;re thinking about , that &apos;s the old hand , don &apos;t tell us that in <unk> , and no beef is more beef or other gene , which i want to do just <unk> and want to do that .
and these two worlds are playing all the time , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing is that if you look at this , this new society , these <unk> , <unk> many of these mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
but not more to local level , but on a global level .
we &apos;ve understood that this is global .
that is a topic of ecology a global .
not if i think local local thinking and the neighbor thinks less <unk> , it doesn &apos;t work so much .
that means , in the local village , it has become a global village with the same principles , of course , at least as well , but also in complete transparency .
as you knew at the time , who has what i have to do and to , because this is what &apos;s going to happen today about this <unk> of our own <unk> globally .
whether we know global <unk> and we get more and faster and more <unk> .
it &apos;s just like it early on to the village .
before the background , i started looking at this , which is what it meant to be , which is , of course , what we might have , but what we might look like , what is the difference for us ?
because often , people are not able to make it <unk> , so that everybody can handle it .
so you have to care about what does that mean , and not just changing it , it &apos;s different , but it should be better .
and when , of course , is something very simple , and how do i think of the image that we can take on and make it look like these things that they can be a <unk> , so that &apos;s how they make fun and they &apos;re just using it .
you &apos;re dealing with , even as a undergraduate , with the subject of perception and the subject .
and that is , of course , where you start and looks like this , and you say , okay , now i just look inside the inner self .
and what is it actually out there ?
so how do we work when we get there ?
and what actually means , of course , intuitive and how do our work work in perception , and how does the cognitive work work ?
because steve jobs used to go to <unk> <unk> to it <unk> <unk> .
so you really have to see in detail , if i want to do something <unk> or intuitive , what that means is .
and there you are , you know , a a <unk> -- the most people think we have only five , it &apos;s already <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly going to be the next future , and the point of extension , even more than that .
and to see how do we process information , how do we collect information ?
to say alone , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many people use the word , but don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to put together in detail .
but i need to understand in the core , in the understanding of information , when information gets information , when information comes from information , from information , from this information , i know how to do things as well , or <unk> of course .
and of course , how does design change influence .
we see this , when i do things , then i can put them all the way out on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can make it intuitive to do things by making things .
so , very much more natural , in a gourd , but i can see it directly , where is salt and pepper .
and if i say to somebody , give me salt or pepper , then he &apos;s thinking about where it &apos;s in there .
and on the left , it &apos;s intuitive , and then i &apos;m hoping that there is no sugar in there to give salt to the salt .
but also our perception ourselves , how does it fool us .
for instance , this perception in context .
the right-hand circle looks larger than the small , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re equally equal to the size , and yet changes our perception , depending on what context we are doing .
anyone know what that is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should be working .
there &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be on my glasses .
so it &apos;s a <unk> .
a second circle starts starting to form certain kind of resemblance .
and then if i &apos;m going to take a <unk> <unk> , then we don &apos;t see each other more than one unit , which is circle , and circle , but we see one unit , we don &apos;t see three pieces , a circle , a circle , a circle , one circle .
this is called <unk> or something called <unk> , which also changes us in perception .
important for the designers who have the most of the first semester , the great <unk> <unk> .
<unk> nearby , <unk> , continuity and continuity .
and then in part of course , they &apos;re forgotten .
but that &apos;s an essential part of what if you want to design things up to you as well as well .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting to see this .
sounds very simple , but it &apos;s so exciting to be concerned about when it &apos;s closer .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now we think we &apos;re looking back from the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;re looking back in front of you .
in fact , they <unk> an assumption , that you see something you can recognize , <unk> circle .
that means we don &apos;t see our minds before we see it back in the back of our <unk> , to say , okay , okay .
i have such a cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
so this is also there , that &apos;s coming back .
then again , again , again , because the back doesn &apos;t the back in the front , and says , right now , please look back again , and you &apos;ll just see if you want to see what you see .
and then it goes back again , and then it &apos;s actually going to happen .
so , a whole , very <unk> process , like certain things act and things that happen to do these things .
i don &apos;t know who you know about this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described to you .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to recognize this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
does anybody see something specific ?
a <unk> , right .
once i saw this , that this is a <unk> inside , then you know .
you &apos;ll never forget , because i &apos;m going to show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and on and now , you see it now .
that means i actually put them so much that they don &apos;t recognize any pattern of <unk> , but i have them <unk> within a very short time , to see again this dog in this <unk> image .
and this is this projection of vision , <unk> .
now i know , and now i &apos;m looking forward to the moment i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very interesting processes that then , in this , yes , gray isn &apos;t you , but here we just put in the <unk> mass of it .
anyone know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always always interesting to know as designers .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i go back to the present , then i can also bridge very well , to work with me , working with three seconds to work .
it doesn &apos;t have to process it as present .
then it goes into the past , so i can be able to bridge very , very elegant , for example , when i know this phenomenon .
what takes <unk> milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
it &apos;s a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time you fall in love .
that means , for example , if you know this , look at you who look at you like long , because i don &apos;t get anything available for what &apos;s going to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the activity of most of our perceptions we have .
that means that first one is going to happen in fast rapid velocity of how we perceive things .
and as we see things also , what we &apos;re paying and how we protect ourselves against our environment , so we could be able to protect that .
of course , the creator , of course , is not only with the subject of perceptions and neural activity , or <unk> , but of course , primarily on the subject .
so , like a human being , according to some things .
there &apos;s more <unk> of the practical functions , so much <unk> aspects of things .
there are <unk> , where i know exactly where , i need to grasp .
but there &apos;s also symbolic features , why do you have a little bit of <unk> , where no matter of <unk> , so <unk> <unk> money money on money , even though it &apos;s not so handy ?
we &apos;re more likely to be on the <unk> , on the <unk> that we are as a creator of course .
back to my actual subject of natural user interface , and the subject , of course , is <unk> .
<unk> means , how can i reach a certain way , or how a single user can be capable of capable to do that , effectively , efficiently , <unk> .
that &apos;s the way the rule says .
how can i do something more <unk> ?
can i control that directly , or do i need a need manual or i need an effective training for it .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
that i &apos;m going to make it different , and i make it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and then , if you &apos;re in some of the software that we saw , on this point , you will also understand why <unk> percent of our own current software don &apos;t use or <unk> to <unk> , although it &apos;s much more intuitive than an classical software .
in the process , intuitive reasoning is not only since printing a elementary process of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , if i want to make technological technology for humans .
why ?
because we usually run through this new kind of <unk> , the natural user <unk> , for example five times faster on average .
you have to imagine that , if you do something about the classic <unk> , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software that &apos;s just one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you will probably take home to four hours , but your employers , or anybody will end up with them for the four hours .
but i want to say that , of course , for example , is that one of these <unk> is to be able to get certain things .
so when we &apos;re going to go back into the domain of the software , this is the first <unk> interfaces that were very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next thing that came up with with a <unk> model or mental <unk> , like , the software model says , &quot; well , you have a notion of something that is the metaphor of a desktop tool for making the computer . &quot;
so no more <unk> and ones or <unk> code , but it &apos;s a metaphor .
that made it greatly <unk> , but it &apos;s also a lot better than that .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works very much more .
so , i think , as a creator , a lot more often the behavior look like this .
this is also a paradigm shift .
in fact , in that time , what you &apos;re looking for is going to be a <unk> , it becomes an application .
and then , if i take one step into this natural user interface , where i communicate with voice , by verbal language , <unk> gestures , and gestures , and no longer , to do a mouse and <unk> the things , i &apos;m even more and more .
but that leads me to the point when the things are actually more intuitive ?
if you become more intuitive , and then i have to take my little friend here and see , what does it mean for a sense of view , when is now something like this ?
and this is for us to always be an intuitive , when i have to think very little about it .
so you don &apos;t like to think of it , but it &apos;s pretty easy to do it .
the more i &apos;m thinking about , the more intuitive it is .
and what does it mean for the designers ?
that is , if we look at that we can use <unk> existing information from a different way , for example , for the example , so i can draw on this as a creator .
that means i can create an intuitive concept of human intelligence into a software and therefore make the software make a difference .
well , of course , the question is , what is actually that <unk> <unk> of human beings , and now i have a little bit of it .
this is what &apos;s called the <unk> .
that &apos;s what each means of us and <unk> is an acronym and orient for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
it &apos;s all of the time of all the time , but it &apos;s subconscious and <unk> , intuitively , instinctively .
the model is going to be <unk> in the womb and so forth , so it works in the world &apos;s young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all over time , without most of the time that the model has been there .
<unk> <unk> is going to be about 50 to <unk> , depending on us as activity , so in the sleep , you have noticed that it &apos;s less less often than than a day .
i can actually orient this mental <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on a <unk> .
and by that kind of transmission , like the metaphor of <unk> , but now more than a metaphor of a physical object , it &apos;s a metaphor of a physical image , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of <unk> than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i &apos;m going to look at this now , for instance , in <unk> , <unk> , as a choice , the informed of the case , it &apos;s coming up to me .
then i can transfer that entire .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a <unk> .
you know , everybody &apos;s eaten .
overall : now i interact with the object , again , <unk> , <unk> .
i can get the whole overview , so you can look at this and say , let me just show you all about chocolate .
and once upon me , a interface that is more intuitive and much more natural .
because , in fact , that i can reach the things like the bits and <unk> , and they come to me , is much more natural than when <unk> <unk> organized , or other mechanisms , can make these things available to these things .
imagination is more <unk> <unk> , and with that sentence , i would like to end up giving a lesson , but designers must be thinking differently , to come up with new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much for your attention .
i want to give you a very particular aspect of curiosity .
the first one , if you &apos;re growing up as a child &apos;s baby , when you take care of what you &apos;re doing like this , yes ? and depending on whether your parents will give them more or less or less and more , your curiosity .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
that &apos;s why all of you are , and i &apos;m curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m going to talk about this , effectively , <unk> this whole , <unk> , <unk> , to put in quality .
and there is a central point there .
and it depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day , they spend more + to give you about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you need to absorb two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise they don &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could just glide as <unk> <unk> .
if we didn &apos;t get phosphorus and don &apos;t get phosphorus .
amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re dealing with something that &apos;s really like <unk> , but it &apos;s not like this .
because all of you talk about energy , but no one talks about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only got phosphorus in two years , and we &apos;re now going to get a lot more uranium in the world in the world as much more uranium in the world as well .
in the last 20 years , 70 tons of uranium have been distributed by our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it &apos;s leukemia .
and we think we would protect the environment when we &apos;re a bit less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , the car , the less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
it &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s how i would say , if your mother would drop your child , beat it three times rather than five times .
that &apos;s just a little bit of destruction .
if we think of that from the <unk> to the <unk> , then our entire earth is going to be used or later a <unk> .
that &apos;s why you think about <unk> <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the bottom , it &apos;s first .
in the bottom , over 60 percent of the <unk> store .
right now , we &apos;re corn and losing the 11 percent of tons of tons per hectare , or on <unk> square .
that is , we lose about five thousand times more than the <unk> .
so , of course , we can look at the <unk> .
and everything is all packaging or content .
for instance , in <unk> , <unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
and because we &apos;re getting older , they &apos;re getting bigger .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re all in the <unk> .
yes ?
a baby &apos;s got to do about six .
we could reduce this , about 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is balanced in china in a second .
it &apos;s totally trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with these <unk> ?
here &apos;s one evidence by the fact that men are not pigs .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus is <unk> out of the pigs .
and the people in the urine .
yeah .
so these men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s done , right ?
traditionally we think in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you give people the people when they say it , if they say that would be better , they &apos;d not be there , they become hostile and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more than to stabilize the human population .
in israel , you know , if you live a million people , you see the earth .
here &apos;s the more you say , the more you get , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , they weigh four times four times more than us .
i may also take termites , but in the u.s. , nobody likes to see termites from this , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means that the ants weigh much more than us .
and because they work much harder harder than we are , and because they are only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption is worth about 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too much , we &apos;re stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re going to do , what we really wanted to achieve and how we feel , we know that we &apos;re at all around the planet , can you see that for instance , there &apos;s been a program to say 20 years , right ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you ever seen a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence is that we want to be dumber than a tree , right ?
yes ?
no tree is not a tree .
fortunately , yes ?
there is no <unk> on trees .
there are still six hundred trees in the country .
you &apos;ve heard some of you about <unk> of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be dumber than a tree .
and where you see , even in demeter , like demeter , the <unk> <unk> farm , it doesn &apos;t allow our own <unk> .
every year we &apos;re losing three million tons of phosphorus that really need to go back into cycles .
and we &apos;re too many .
alone .
that means we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and how all of them are willing to be our own <unk> .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to make less harmful to being <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s really about having a large footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , is the highest , not that ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> if you &apos;re not there .
even if you were shooting shooting , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve it .
we can do it differently .
we can regain our nutrients .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil from where we regain the nutrients .
directly , we can actually grow nutrients into this way .
we do this in china , for example , where we take the waste out of this .
in china , one of a <unk> today is <unk> , so , right ?
and in our western world we were always too dumb , so we remove our nutrients .
that means the whole western <unk> draws out that the city has always taken , but the farmers never never returned .
so , cities had to grow more , because the farmers go into the cities , and the cities had to keep getting their nutrients .
so all of the western empires are expanding , until they don &apos;t have the good infrastructure , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve got <unk> civilization for five thousand years , because you &apos;ve always been able to get the nutrients down .
even today , when you &apos;re invited to dinner in china , you expect to be waiting for you to stay out the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> , to get the nutrients out .
you &apos;ve got them invited to eat , not to <unk> .
that means you can see in the internet , you can see the nutrients .
this is actually a nice thing , if you do this , agriculture does , provide a hectare of land with five thousand people in favelas , so that a farmer can take about <unk> dollars and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and fish .
and the great thing about this is that the <unk> in the favelas is about 700 percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control people , to be very bad .
we can support them , good .
this is <unk> , of course , but the <unk> are carrying themselves .
the byproduct is clean clean water .
and they &apos;re designed to work through the design that a farmer can just farm .
that means that the <unk> will go back .
and none of these <unk> , we &apos;ve now been building over <unk> over the last 20 years , none of these <unk> has ever been <unk> .
you could just remove a liter of a liter , and then it will be ruined over years .
not won &apos;t .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people , to be very bad .
we can support them , good .
that means we have to <unk> phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what they want to do is , in germany , they &apos;re best at best wastewater treatment is in <unk> .
unfortunately , unfortunately not in <unk> , but maybe you can get a little bit more <unk> .
because the <unk> <unk> could best regain the phosphorus .
and it needs to be back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s quite difficult .
we &apos;ve been deployed now in three years now .
the dutch government has explained that they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world that phosphorus is <unk> .
but we need the overall .
you know , there are two countries that are controlling almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s fastest .
there &apos;s opec a pile of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries who control 40 percent of the control .
and the oil will be replaced by other energy carriers .
but the phosphorus will not replace the phosphorus .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s not about trying to make it a little less less bad , but it &apos;s about making things right .
and first of all , first of all , is what the right is .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
in holland , you can understand that , of course , because in the u.k. is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if you &apos;re sad at your wife , if you have them <unk> them , and they come to 50 of them .
completely inefficient .
but it &apos;s really effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany , about six <unk> three kilograms of their life .
over here .
it &apos;s scientifically not exactly right , because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> are going on .
but a <unk> , even in this illumination , i can tell you that &apos;s completely inefficient , but it &apos;s effective , right ?
one thing that is beautiful is not efficient .
that &apos;s not about resource efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
to ask , what is the right ?
not , you know , <unk> a little bit better , and get it out and burn it into the amount of materials for all the materials , but first to ask them , how do you tie up cycles ?
imagine mozart used to .
yes ?
if i went to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , wonderful ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that is beautiful is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that &apos;s in life is not about saving to avoid .
all the <unk> .
we tell people , oh yeah , you don &apos;t have a green green green .
no , that &apos;s just the right thing , right ?
at any point where you go from , you know , you get <unk> .
but the wrong thing .
if you put the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
in the way we think of the north .
there &apos;s a footprint of <unk> footprint .
if you walk , yes , destroyed a raw footprint .
because the ground is going to die from mosses , and the wind and the water is washing the ground away .
if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water remains longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a great footprint that is a marsh .
not <unk> .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask them , how do you do with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
don &apos;t save , avoiding avoid .
any waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , like the people in the high plate , as a <unk> coke looks out of the car .
because , you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the proper design , please .
so for example , we &apos;ve developed a <unk> , which is a liquid in temperature temperature .
they can <unk> them , where they go and go .
you know , in two hours it builds up everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants , so that they can pull it out to biodiversity .
that is , we are useful , not less harmful .
so there are two cycles .
not all of it should be <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , they just use them , they don &apos;t use them .
just things like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , that must be like they &apos;re going to go to biological systems .
the things that are only used to work in technical systems .
but today , we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , <unk> ? yes ?
direct directly , not for the company <unk> <unk> per se , but that they &apos;re helping this aid to help these products .
because we don &apos;t make things out of free .
yes ?
so , if i <unk> them to eat and say , this is free of <unk> , it doesn &apos;t help them .
no , we lay out what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic in it .
but everything that &apos;s in there is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can <unk> the <unk> on the <unk> , and the rubber in biological loops , right ?
everything is <unk> .
and if it works us , of course , for instance , for <unk> , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s the half of all the <unk> globally that are caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why you ask you , ask yourself with people .
hey , <unk> , are you really serious ?
because now , they have now changed twice .
and i &apos;m not sure whether they really <unk> .
so , let me help you a little bit about this .
but it goes .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been presented .
this is .
we can do things like this , if you <unk> them , if you <unk> , you can dive into biological cycles .
technical cycles in the same way .
there &apos;s a direct sign for this .
this is the first green backpack , actually , which is made to go back into the circulation .
so that &apos;s what you can do , so you can put things out there .
if you come to this , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> ?
when the moment is the waste .
all the <unk> is <unk> around .
in the countries where people get to money .
there &apos;s the <unk> up there , but also in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastic so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , inside that you can actually go back to a baby in israel or in the <unk> of <unk> trees .
yes ?
if you take this pen , if you take this <unk> , sterile , getting the powder to plant trees .
so this is the baby <unk> for the whole life , at the beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of a <unk> <unk> .
yeah , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can even reinvent again .
i set up a institute .
and there &apos;s a lot of people who have a lot of people with that .
there are some kind of treatment for <unk> , where everybody can join .
so not save saving , avoiding avoid , reduce , not <unk> , but intelligent energy .
does that matter ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music as a language .
in the description of my speech , i wrote that as a <unk> , <unk> as a <unk> , i know it in the english world .
<unk> are the <unk> notes in music music .
that you don &apos;t just write the word word for the word into text to the other language , but to understand the deeper sense of words and <unk> , so that it gives you a decent translation , everybody knows who has done with <unk> .
translate from english in english english can have more knowledge , as if it comes to poetry , or poetry to them .
but strangers , it &apos;s kind of alien to what we do with our <unk> .
as a filmmaker , i wrote the first notes .
you think that the composer has the exact same notes everything he has imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are something like the same or <unk> , like a verbal , if very seemingly <unk> carefully , description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of flowers don &apos;t smell , you know , the <unk> of the <unk> can &apos;t see the <unk> of the <unk> , not to feel it .
that means that the language has to give up the <unk> of the <unk> into a different one , namely , <unk> , <unk> language .
today , i want to tell you what i &apos;m going to do musically in , but <unk> , once again into language .
so , practically a translation is translation .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do that in german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be meant to me in translation of translation translation .
so that &apos;s the way the music works for me as much as the spoken word .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letter of a script .
so it &apos;s not going to read , read , read , read , reading the keys on the piano or the keys in the right place .
and that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the words of the letters don &apos;t recognize if you can do it .
so , for the learning process of doing music , at least as long as the spoken language .
there is also <unk> , if you learn it for the <unk> , you can only be able to speak and speak to the other native speaker .
the work of the <unk> starts to look like the <unk> .
after first , you &apos;ve chosen to play a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about this , you &apos;re going to go to history of the composition of composition .
you collect information about the piece in the <unk> .
you read reads in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether there are words , thoughts from composers .
you study studies that he wrote back and <unk> .
you compare them .
the <unk> to write it .
how and what did he felt ?
how were his circumstances of the society and the politics ?
all this is interested .
you think about this time , looking for contemporary images and read literature .
but with the time , you know , even as an interpreter , a lot of knowledge to the composers , and you get a lot more and feel easier to feel inside yourself .
the theme is always more to the friend that lives together .
his hands to write the piece is more and more to my personal cause to play it .
now , the notes are all other than an accurate record of the subject of the subject , but just a framework , i &apos;m going to take this framework for meaning back to meaning to it .
so i can say to my own words , which is something between this framework .
i play <unk> , which could sound that sound .
now for me and for composers , and what they might mean for today .
every sound , every phrase gets a sense , because i feel it , because it &apos;s from my <unk> <unk> .
it has to be for me in here and now <unk> , and i can &apos;t convince my audience that this is my cause .
it &apos;s always a happy happy concert , so if i can have the experience , the piece that i have worked in so much more like that .
as you experience a happy new days , even with the same rituals of life , stand up , breakfast , breakfast , work , and then you can see the same piece again , again , again .
i grew up a day older to change seasons , when my pulse goes at slow down when it morning , in an hour , it takes longer for the sound back back to home .
i take the mood of the audience , unseen , unconsciously .
all of this influenced to me and all of the influenced by the composition of composition .
and it &apos;s really wonderful when i &apos;m standing on stage stage and we have the same wavelength .
and then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you bring a new idea , and immediately it gets this answer to a response .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things happen to happen , which is that we don &apos;t have <unk> and what you can &apos;t do with that .
it &apos;s great fun to do this kind of music , and as people in the audience have experienced what music is communicating .
so each concert is another concert .
i will never want to play more like this in the moment .
i can &apos;t play today like this in 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to have a lot more <unk> , more emotions and emotion and emotion than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to also have some <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m also making new <unk> .
i may have a nice thing to do that .
it was on an <unk> for <unk> to my beloved old teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a well-known <unk> , <unk> and a professor of <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was too young too much so that he was more <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i was very lucky enough to meet him for the age of 13 , and i was in my class at school classes .
i was then 17 years ago when i went to one of his classes again , and played the last one of the four <unk> of chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> was for me .
this is kind of a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
and he said , &quot; well , &quot; right ?
that must be the <unk> .
because for me , it means memory .
he was already over over 60 .
well , with 17 , you still have dreams , but there are no meaningful memories .
i &apos;m going to play this for a couple of years today , and it always changed it for me , even though it has changed nothing .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again , i read something new .
an example from a very different area : monet has painted <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but there &apos;s a different <unk> of light , <unk> light .
he wrote the <unk> <unk> , as he saw them , as he looked at it .
his personal <unk> of <unk> .
so the <unk> interpretation of a piece is comparable .
now , i &apos;ve been older than now when he was writing the song when he wrote the piece .
he was only living years ago .
and it &apos;s important to me again to look at the notes , even though i can memorize them .
to stop <unk> , right ?
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said , you know , you need to be about just as long as the spoken word .
so , often , the math teacher is that you learn to read the notes .
you learn how to read first before you only have one word .
you learn to find the notes to the notes .
and then all of the fingers on time , and just as you get in the notes , you come up and sound sounds like the sound like that .
when the margin is done , the student gets the <unk> piece .
it &apos;s not spoken in interpretation of interpretation .
well , that &apos;s right up there , this is a quick piece .
<unk> , slow .
it &apos;s loud and <unk> , f and b , etc .
you know the most .
but even if you put these data , it &apos;s still just something technical .
and still , it &apos;s always interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder , you often get something completely <unk> .
that is , to make music on the instrument that will be musical and feel about it before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn that , because the parents don &apos;t have <unk> , it won &apos;t do it .
that &apos;s like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and ideas of music , then then beyond another way to make sound .
people who never sang , they have never felt immediate to their own body , as it is to form a sound .
one phrase with his own breath .
the music instrument is the expansion of our body .
our vocal chords led to sing , our hands and feet , to dance .
so the play is on the piano of my finger .
the melody comes from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> nowadays nowadays with music is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make music anymore if it gets bored .
no longer need to sing a clapping or sing .
any own music will be <unk> when you &apos;re constantly changing music from constantly .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
i think they can &apos;t sing , a , because they believe they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they don &apos;t learn to sing ?
in fact , it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out if they can &apos;t , or learn to learn how to do these little muscles that used the vocal chords that they use .
you can do that .
or c , because you have it <unk> you are <unk> .
i mean , how <unk> resourceful , this diagnosis ?
did you have a <unk> or <unk> , how do you say it now ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you want to have nothing to do with nothing .
but what i would regret about , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can still <unk> .
well , you can see , you don &apos;t have to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t tell you , i don &apos;t understand anything of the classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
i say , &quot; but sure you can tell you whether you like them or not . &quot;
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if it tastes to me because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t eat no food because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to give up to classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to them , and tell them whether it tastes them or not .
whether or music is to be too sweet or sweet .
tell you what you feel .
in time , you can get <unk> and pour some more spices , or taste taste <unk> .
why do i ask me from my audience now that it &apos;s actively actively listening ?
because the music is a language , and language is a language .
a piece of art that you &apos;re never looking at is not a force .
so the food that was treated by a chef or a cook <unk> , must be eaten , didn &apos;t have looked at the way or recipes .
so please please hear when music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in a environment where the adults are actively doing music or at the most active music , a kid is growing up , it &apos;s very easy for a <unk> , which is the color of your flower ?
can you also play me in blue ?
and the kid plays , after a <unk> , instead of a red red , it &apos;s a blue flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
and then this was the very first stage of a musical piece .
so the first step into an interpretation .
and what happens when you &apos;re playing a piece of this before , which was originally ago before ago , <unk> <unk> or two years ago ?
meanwhile , the instruments have begun .
there was no piano at the time of the stream .
it wasn &apos;t just invented yet .
i think that it &apos;s been going to be thrilled to have the <unk> of modern modern <unk> .
i can see the <unk> that the bach had , in the modern sound sound , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
music can tell you that he heard more than he had been deaf .
today , it &apos;s a modern orchestra capable of playing everything that an orchestra has been <unk> as well .
that &apos;s why composers are dependent upon us to reinvent the pieces .
so they &apos;re going to be audible , what they have only imagined in the mind .
and also , what you think are in the mind today .
or what i &apos;d like to do today is because what you could think about .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
have you ever been jealous ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a <unk> .
so , if i come back with my little v of the <unk> , and this is where i think .
i shoot something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need to have a big car ?
yes , it &apos;s lost half the year after the first year .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to do a little car ?
and then it immediately drops to me , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word of justice , this awkward sense .
our organism has invented a great way to get such unpleasant emotions like fear just to disappear .
you can also try that with words like revenge or <unk> or something .
i want to explain to you with this mechanism today , or something that you &apos;re familiar with is something familiar with you .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard , when people say , no one has to build a wall .
and then rocks send them out of the front of them .
in a lie , you see that the liars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it turns out to look easily , that it has a little bit of meaning in it .
it &apos;s just <unk> you and not himself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about is that you have to deceive you .
you need this lie to get a <unk> to get an <unk> .
they can get less easy , yes , <unk> , or <unk> .
they need time .
from that time , a anecdote that you might know .
spanish <unk> <unk> picasso has a woman <unk> .
this woman has complained , the portrait would never look at the same .
picasso , wait just .
it &apos;s always more like this .
in this place , and if you laugh , you realize how important lies lie , and how much time you need to see something that artists can tell us about .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
and the artists share with you , and especially about this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see if you just look in the mirror .
and the artists share with you with a portrait that you &apos;ll only become familiar with when you look at this art over again .
and then that awkward feeling , it may not look at the same way , and it &apos;s going to be more like that .
here they have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention for the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not only in art , even in the <unk> , in the mythology , in stories , it appeared again .
now you may know this idea of the lady who woke up in the morning and looked at him , who is the most beautiful in the whole country ?
one day , the mirror says , &quot; yes , there &apos;s a <unk> . &quot;
behind the seven mountains , and so on .
and they also know how much hostility of that true tells us , and the mirror can &apos;t lie , from the true information .
but we should be familiar with this to tell you that a woman can &apos;t tell you that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere there .
here &apos;s what it takes for what we understand underwater is <unk> .
we need this lie of this lie that gives us a <unk> <unk> that we can &apos;t even live .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in the <unk> , but in science , that great lies .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s <unk> of <unk> .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of the species and the descent of man .
that man was supposed to be from the monkey , and , yes , it was a common ancestry between humans and apes .
and then she ran her up to her husband and said , that &apos;s probably not what the story writes .
the man was supposed to be from the monkey <unk> , or a common ancestry .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to get the knowledge of knowledge .
why do we need to know that people get knowledge from something when it is true ?
because we can &apos;t live without those <unk> .
because we <unk> that <unk> , this feeling of being great , descent of the highest creatures , not by any kind of <unk> , from something like this organism as a organism that exists yet , like a <unk> , and whatever things that is for us .
so , we can &apos;t bear in these things .
we need to know that people get knowledge from things , especially when they are true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism can bounce out , and how the traces look like it &apos;s going to lead to something else than this is a great picture of ourselves , i want to give you a little story .
it &apos;s a particularly beautiful story , like me .
my wife told me .
she came one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told them about a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to particularly like him because he has a tendency to sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you feel it when you &apos;re standing in this place . there &apos;s nothing wrong .
i told my wife , whenever i was a human <unk> in the moral basis , because we should try to replace it through the most <unk> selves .
and then they do that , and then they learn the sentence .
even though i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
it &apos;s really the real truth behind us .
so a little bit of <unk> , who doesn &apos;t care about <unk> .
the interest to <unk> .
but there are no clubs , where we can look around where you learn how to do fire .
there &apos;s just the second best thing , the fire fire .
so he signed up .
and <unk> , you also don &apos;t tell you to get fires at some place somewhere , and if you &apos;re happy with the fire afterwards .
no , it just looks much better when we show that we &apos;re going to put on the dangers of getting the risks that they &apos;re having to fire fire .
so here &apos;s the little mechanism here .
and this <unk> remind you that the <unk> of the <unk> already knew that it was actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say it .
here they have this <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious mind , <unk> , and that she can do something about it , and the things that they know , they look very much better for them and others .
so these are just these kinds of words that we can actually use in the language of the politically correct language .
we actually know that something else is .
but we know when we tell it , the social issues are very sensitive to it .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
so i want to give you the point of what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
according to the logic of that deception , that <unk> , the willingness to become a different reality than the ones that we actually know in the unconscious , that it &apos;s valid for the outside .
and i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is that what many of you know about , and some of you appreciate very , very few things at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so powerful , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not about stop <unk> , natural nature .
and so , if you have the people who have a stable belief that they own a soul , or you can also say , believe that they &apos;ve come from life to life .
and from this soul , you know , somehow , in this nature of nature , in this <unk> nature , is called <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
and if that <unk> and then forth over the people , then it &apos;s filled with his mind , with spirit that only can live , only with a soul .
and then he can <unk> .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so she &apos;s going to come from the outside to the people .
so we should be able to see them as something that is necessarily true for our lives .
and if you have those principles , you know , the logic , with which we experience this happiness can improve our world through a lie .
because now you can use a <unk> .
<unk> , they still know from school .
now this is now a <unk> , which tells us a logic .
this is the hardest part of my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
that &apos;s what lying is that they &apos;re just applied to <unk> the logic .
in this <unk> , they sentence three sentences .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there is no soul .
so the second sentence is , when <unk> is right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i highlighted specifically here .
third one , and it immediately appeared in people who have a strong sense of a soul .
the people who don &apos;t have no soul , that &apos;s dead and can &apos;t say nothing .
and here &apos;s it .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this <unk> talk , expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , these are logical correct .
i mean , i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statements about reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , it &apos;s not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but the key is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so when <unk> says , there is no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now we see our consciousness immediately , so you can do something .
it &apos;s going to commit a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences and doing it as if the opposite of the first sentence already have proved and provided it .
because in fact , we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul .
but with this logic that simply simply says that two sentences are correct , and a third <unk> that looks like it would be done with it , so we can save our <unk> .
so , we do pretend that it &apos;s actually impossible not to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things to different examples .
in the present , we have a modern modern example that keeps filling up the <unk> .
and then you have to be another <unk> subject to consider a <unk> from a philosophy of philosophy .
that has to do that we go back to the 19th century .
there was a <unk> , which was johannes <unk> , and after this is named <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> that &apos;s made of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
this is like a <unk> .
and if you put that exactly in the middle between two <unk> , then he <unk> it .
because he doesn &apos;t know what beck should go first .
so it &apos;s in the middle right there .
so the <unk> introduced .
<unk> forces <unk> <unk> each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
so only if you bring a different kind of thing , so if you immediately do the kind of haystack , it doesn &apos;t have any reason and it &apos;s nothing .
it automatically goes to the right thoughts .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven by nature , it &apos;s driven by a larger pile that attract you to immediately , and then you have that feeling like that will be like a free will .
and if we &apos;re here in <unk> , i remember the <unk> of science research .
there &apos;s a <unk> , which is wolf <unk> , and he tells you sometimes , wolf <unk> , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can form the second sentence and can tell , when wolf &apos;s right , he didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are totally logical and correct .
and what we can now see in the daily daily day , that will be found in this third sentence .
it looks like he doesn &apos;t have any <unk> , not allowed for his actions and rejected to accountability , and it &apos;s therefore <unk> .
again , they have it again .
in fact , you have to have to prove whether it &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception is to allow us to do that as the first sentence was actually false than you would have to adopt the opposite with no consequence .
and now you can just imagine if you want to do anything if you want yourself to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , you have practice that <unk> .
practice this for example , when you meet the people who you can say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , called the prophet .
they can &apos;t call it that again , again , a little politically <unk> .
they say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you &apos;ll be able to see one of those kinds of <unk> , you know , you can &apos;t prove it .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy working to themselves , that they can &apos;t prove evidence that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man &apos;s very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he <unk> them .
because he &apos;s led to a <unk> , and he &apos;s oblivious to himself .
because actually , this man is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s just interested in itself , <unk> itself in the need to prove to prove that there is <unk> .
so , in the kind of climate change , you see the brilliance of lying .
and once again , you have such an opportunity to feel that <unk> in other people , do it , because they will make others happy if they don &apos;t remember them in their way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i allowed myself to ask if i could mention them .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here from this great event , and asked me whether i want to give a talk here and i think of the idea .
i have to say honestly , you did it <unk> , it was hard to talk about my idea .
and i may be able to imagine my <unk> , that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but of course , it &apos;s the sum , quite many ideas .
i &apos;m probably one of the two nice girls here , i &apos;m probably probably one of the generation that &apos;s given to this bad <unk> image , because i started learning engineering in engineering , engineering school , today i believe , kit .
and then , in the &apos; 80s , i &apos;ve been to <unk> berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and there &apos;s nothing in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
the name of all , <unk> was called <unk> .
they &apos;re now called <unk> .
because a good engineer designed either built cars or <unk> .
but sort of like <unk> , like <unk> , from some hundred watts come out of the square , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy <unk> .
i &apos;m the grateful grateful that he had the word back again again because the <unk> couldn &apos;t use the word at all , because everything left left was a bad thing .
but in fact , it wasn &apos;t in the <unk> years .
there was the idea that there were <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> where they felt that evil .
and the place of <unk> , but this was <unk> , and it was called and wind and solar and created in the <unk> .
and yeah , a lot of what &apos;s been told today is because , many , many beautiful expressions of what i have lived through .
i &apos;ve been working on the <unk> for 11 years .
we were twenty people .
if one of the people said it was the <unk> , which has been an <unk> , and i spent 10 years , so i was really hard to get into a <unk> thing , because my father &apos;s friends had always <unk> him , you &apos;ve got the money for your baby .
it &apos;s kind of busy .
and it was really , very <unk> , and then you get it in such a hole , which appeared to give up a picture of what i asked for about 10 years , a <unk> <unk> , <unk> of course , whether it really was going to be so great .
and then i went to until then <unk> until then , then with friends , i grew up the founder of the company that came together with the largest <unk> of one of the largest <unk> of the world .
now , a <unk> , but also , of course , we have the problem of a growing company , and we then have <unk> , a small group , decided that we start to make small and start thinking about the next thing that we &apos;re talking about .
and i &apos;ve brought to me a project that i want to introduce you now .
and the title of this was , as you get to a hundred percent of renewables .
and we just just started with a very simple story of questions , where could you make a memory of a lot of time today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there was four and a half thousand people .
they have today more renewables from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
it &apos;s just not technological .
when they add more <unk> to each other , it starts to fail .
this is what i &apos;m always telling the politicians when they become in our <unk> .
they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
but it can &apos;t be a problem .
but it &apos;s not true , in fact , in seven percent , and our web is physically the european european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we &apos;d have the same problems that people have on that island .
the question was just simple , and this was the beginning of <unk> , the first <unk> started with the island , we just expect it .
how big would you have to be a battery so you have to give up an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go further .
the conventional system looks like all over the world .
by the way , every year , about a hundred <unk> , electrical <unk> at the <unk> world .
that &apos;s the cost of a hundred nuclear power plants , because this is very fast anywhere .
the <unk> of the world that &apos;s happening is being saved by diesel , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s fast .
you put it in a box .
and then it looks like this .
in the end , three of the <unk> , two will be waiting forever .
yes , this is actually a burden on the bottom .
we also have very detailed data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> , or whatever it is , is usually a <unk> system or a system that can only accumulate in small quantities .
our goal was to say , &quot; okay . &quot;
the gasoline is <unk> and the wind , the sun will hold so that they can map the wider range .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , the energy per year , don &apos;t have the output in the moment , then you have to turn off the reuse .
that means , in the moment , you &apos;ve got to worry that renewables is going to take over the net .
and of course , you can do that , if you &apos;re in some kind of <unk> here .
that hasn &apos;t done that in the world .
that &apos;s a little bit of <unk> , so you can also drive your car on your car on a small <unk> .
people always ask me , what would you do in this room ?
that &apos;s already .
but if you want to do a lot of these <unk> , and you want to build a network , it becomes very complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to 70 percent of renewable energy , and then there &apos;s the rest of the rest , the last 10 , twenty percent renewable , which is going to work very , very expensive , and it won &apos;t work that you do it for batteries .
this will be an energy supply , which is , hydrogen , methane , methane to gas , you know , or it &apos;s going to be it .
you &apos;ve got to go on to go and see <unk> and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know what , because with a normal , <unk> battery battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then they did a whole bunch of simulation .
and wind and sun , and the <unk> and came to the conclusion , a very exciting outcome , that they &apos;re going to take a middle of about 50 cents per hour per hour , costing 50 percent per hour .
this was the very first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
you know , we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper to do that when the average five percent per year goes up .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> .
what would be done ?
we started to investors with investors , i was looking for new <unk> .
we were at first time to have five people to rebuild new society .
and here &apos;s the picture .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system has a system of power , because it &apos;s less than 20 percent of petrol and petrol on the other thing .
and the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of the island , that &apos;s what we think is great .
but we want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin where we could sort of map the <unk> <unk> of the island at three dimensions exactly .
that means we &apos;ve been looking for finding the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes out of asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> , she was <unk> at the &apos; 70s , <unk> , <unk> , and then became <unk> to the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has an megawatts of power , and it can take six hours for them , and that &apos;s the battery that we have sort of <unk> <unk> .
and then put it up .
we have one of these <unk> in the same size , as he &apos;s standing there , in the hall , actually , the whole dynamic behavior of this web , so in the back , the <unk> battery , here is the largest battery that we can simulate the grid .
so , here we &apos;re going to simulate the whole thing that happens all the <unk> , which is the <unk> cables that we put in the web network .
and here you can see this whole .
we can <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net .
so here &apos;s what we see here again , again , again , the same <unk> , here again , individual <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve been since , since <unk> , the hall ended up until then <unk> <unk> all of this , which is between the single system in electronics to develop software , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define as a company that &apos;s just about the theme of the battery , and the topic is in between .
you need to communicate to the battery , you can also have to communicate to the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing about the topic that you &apos;re basically taking on this island today will be the problems that we can get when we want to raise our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , how is going to go back and forth , <unk> , <unk> , how to go on the island , for example , for example , for 30 percent <unk> , we eat the wind and the sun .
so <unk> <unk> up to <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can begin to integrate on the island of building <unk> , <unk> , can you manage the load .
that is , if you &apos;re on <unk> percent of renewables , you can &apos;t do it without memory .
you can go through &apos; n <unk> , you can go through the bed nets , yes , you should be doing it , you know , the amount of <unk> , but you will never ever give up to memory .
and that &apos;s like a little bit of the message .
so there &apos;s a lot of people , and look at this , because you can see what problems are you .
if you turn rid of petrol , you don &apos;t have this spinning mass of <unk> that have a sense of <unk> in the net .
and our <unk> model basically consists of <unk> seemingly masses of large <unk> , wherever the wave is all around europe .
we &apos;re looking at this web , the 50 hertz shows , and when it &apos;s nine <unk> of four , we &apos;re going to start some <unk> <unk> , then a little bit of steam <unk> , then we get up .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly inert .
if you put it somewhere somewhere , it &apos;ll take some time .
the <unk> reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , they can react to other .
if you don &apos;t have that , this spinning mass , you need to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can rotate with this large battery , two milliseconds .
there you already have the enormous amount of scaling up there .
and the message is , we need to stop at this rotating mass , if we &apos;re going to <unk> our goals , 20 , twenty percent , 30 percent , and 30 percent , and so on , if we want to achieve that at all .
then we need to <unk> our <unk> capacity .
so <unk> is simply , the power station goes on to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a <unk> moment at the moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t know or <unk> , because that &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to tell you that you have the capacity to <unk> , <unk> , by providing <unk> nutrients into the net .
now , there are now a whole lot of studies now .
and to this purpose , people always come and look at our <unk> on our way .
and yes , the discussion is always about asking the question , how far can you go up there a bit far away .
and many discussions i &apos;ve had in the last six years were similar to the debate that i &apos;ve been doing with the last 30 years .
don &apos;t happen , <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;ve all <unk> all it .
we &apos;ve got 500 <unk> today in germany .
this is <unk> .
and i just go from that , in the next 30 years , we are able to store the same capacity of <unk> capacity around the world .
it &apos;s just like this .
there will be so much of <unk> and <unk> arguments .
the beauty is , i &apos;ve sort of experienced this in the last two years , that the scientists are looking at my own .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million <unk> now , to get a <unk> <unk> to <unk> web .
this will be in the next april of april .
so from that , you know , there &apos;s a change that &apos;s going to be there , and it &apos;s just about that <unk> , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable energy is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable energy , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so , in the time , arguments are always trying to do these <unk> , which are <unk> , they have a very small web , which has nothing to do with our <unk> .
the question is , quite simply , if you &apos;re completely separate from any of the fossil or the fossil <unk> that will become anywhere in the world , and then you &apos;ll be <unk> , then you &apos;re an island .
then they only go from what &apos;s going on to the sun and wind up there , where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a global energy supply , and i &apos;m also grateful for you guys to say , solar power .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in that way , the talk of <unk> <unk> is that you can become a collective and be solar , and then make it a little together .
and yeah , i want to encourage you to encourage you , in the sense that you may be quiet and be able to have a vision .
and you &apos;ve got to be quite <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going on .
thank you .
when steve lopez , new york times , he was walking through the streets of los angeles , he was a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless , who played on a violin , who had only had two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from <unk> papers , she got a book that came into <unk> , robert robert junior <unk> , when robert lopez and jamie <unk> were <unk> , <unk> , who had been successfully groundbreaking by his <unk> career , early <unk> .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a <unk> , and 30 years later , he lived on the streets of <unk> <unk> at the center of los angeles .
i &apos;m going to read you all of you , <unk> book , or see the film , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that has been formed between these two men , but also the instrument that allows you to get this <unk> , nathaniel <unk> from the street .
i met mr. <unk> <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , walt walt <unk> hall .
he had just heard a presentation by beethoven &apos;s first song and fourth third symphony , and came back to the stage to imagine .
he spoke to a very <unk> and <unk> sound about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , how the dodgers never would do in the baseball world , and the last part of the <unk> passage in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s symphony symphony .
we got to talk to the music , and a few days later i received an email , which was , nathaniel <unk> was interested in <unk> .
i have to say that nathaniel gave him a medical treatment , because he was already being used with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that had been his life to life .
as a result of it , it &apos;s particularly susceptible to these schizophrenics stages . these are so bad , and it &apos;s so bad , and it goes to the streets of <unk> <unk> , always with horror and horror of his own mind .
and in fact , in this case , nathaniel did , when we did our first lesson back to walt disney hall , and he had this amazingly <unk> <unk> in his eyes , and was completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and complaining about how she wanted to poison in their sleep .
i was afraid , not <unk> , but i was afraid that i could lose , he could sink in one of his conditions , and that i could break him on the scale of the violin , when i started thinking about the scales , and i started to talk about other exciting forms .
so i just started to play .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s book .
and as i played , i realized that in a <unk> view , a complete change was moving .
it was as if it was under the impact of a <unk> drug , a chemical reaction that was a catalyst to be a catalyst .
<unk> <unk> turns out to transform , into a <unk> curiosity and awe .
and like through a miracle , he took his violin , and he began to listen to some <unk> clips of play , and then asked me to play her at all , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and then we started talking about music , i &apos;m starting by talking about beethoven , beethoven , <unk> , and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t only have a <unk> knowledge of music , but also connected with a close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i would only know about my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by playing music and music , it was out of this <unk> , confused man who had moved on the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> trained <unk> .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel <unk> music music .
because the music allows him to express his thoughts and delusions with his imagination , creativity .
and so he <unk> his <unk> .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
that &apos;s why the reason we make music is that we have something that &apos;s in all of us , deep inside , all of our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of that expression , all of us , is driven and inspired , and united .
what did this story , it brought the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music would bring it back into a family of musicians who had his sense that his talent and realized it .
and i &apos;m going to go back to nathaniel making no matter where walt disney <unk> hall , or weeks of <unk> , because he reminds me of why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you very much . thank you .

robert gupta : i want to play something that i stole around the <unk> .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two .
this first one , this was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , fine consistency , <unk> , a book on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was <unk> in <unk> to the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could think of it , you know , to sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the head of the company said , &quot; if i could talk a week to talk about the sustainability of the farm . &quot;
and of course , i said .
here was a company to try to solve what was this huge problem for our chefs , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years we &apos;ve dug the ocean as we had forests forests .
it &apos;s hard to protect the destruction .
90 percent of the great fish that we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;ve collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , of course , <unk> or <unk> , a part of our future .
so , many arguments , against <unk> pollute the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna that is a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a <unk> from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of <unk> are required to get a <unk> .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here was a company that was trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
on the day of the event , i called the head of <unk> for the company .
we call it .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts right , you &apos;re famous famous to grow far out in the ocean that your environment doesn &apos;t penetrate . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste comes from our fish is not concentrated . &quot;
and then he would add , &quot; we are basically a world .
this <unk> of <unk> said one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> , one , great .
&quot; <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . did it .
and at that night , i was in bed , and i thought , &quot; what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i got the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t think .
i said , &quot; don , don &apos;t , &quot; why ?
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to answer .
well , i <unk> with some people in the company , and i couldn &apos;t give me a proper answer . until i finally arrived with the senior biologists .
we also call them .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are the sustainable example ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , fragments and <unk> .
i said , &quot; how much of your favorite chicken is chicken ? &quot;
in fact , maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what is sustainable in order to feed your fish ? &quot;
there was a long break in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i <unk> myself from that fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
i actually am .
no , i actually had <unk> in this fish , because , i swear to god , who &apos;s eating his dog after chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you ever know your fish , you know the fish you know more .
i put it first in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had recently talked about this fish .
it <unk> us in a sense .
he came to the table with a bright , <unk> white color .
the chef had him <unk> .
wait twice .
amazingly , he was always delicious .
who can make it nice to fish that after he got <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
we call it <unk> . it actually says <unk> .
and no , he doesn &apos;t eat the fish and he &apos;s not a chef ; at least in the way they understand and i can understand .
he &apos;s a biologist with <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the stream of the stream .
up to the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they grew up <unk> , which was basically the wetlands .
they did this by raising the country .
they built these complicated kinds of channels , and they kept behind water from the land and out in the river .
now they couldn &apos;t make it that was working , not economically .
and <unk> was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds in which this place is many birds .
and so 1982 , a spanish company has bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water .
they literally literally <unk> the levers .
instead of using water , they were using the canals to <unk> the water back .
they &apos;re <unk> channels .
they created a <unk> hectare of <unk> -- <unk> , shrimp , shrimp , <unk> -- and they have <unk> and his company to <unk> its ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen this .
they stare out of the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is <unk> channels and this density , lush march .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago with <unk> .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and part of &quot; a crocodile . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we struggled with the wetlands , and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> to my knees and <unk> <unk> to retire .
this is he <unk> a rare <unk> .
now he &apos;s called the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here &apos;s a pattern of bundle that bundle it to the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> are the greatest part of his career in national national park in africa .
i asked him how he became a <unk> <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and <unk> in a talk of rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , which was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community community , like that .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was really <unk> about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had at the <unk> .
so i went him . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does your fish be so good ? &quot;
he pointed to algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fishes ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he &apos;s going to tell me that it &apos;s a rich system that the fish we eat , what they would eat in the wild .
the tropical biomass , the phytoplankton , the plankton , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
there is no food .
the <unk> of the farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
and on the day , i went on this site with <unk> <unk> , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place , of course , &quot; as a kind of farm that i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
at the moment , it was like a film that he asked a <unk> .
and we bow around the corner , and we got the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker <unk> , literally literally <unk> carpet .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you <unk> your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> .
now last year , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s now the biggest part of one of the most important <unk> in europe in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> , not the last one that you &apos;d like to have a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not hard .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the human the gut the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed , and a farm that doesn &apos;t take their own health on its own .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , the <unk> should not be there once .
they breed in a city of 240 kilometers away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning you fly around 240 miles to farm .
and they &apos;ll fly 10 miles away .
they do this because they can follow the <unk> white <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
so i &apos;d been looking at a kind of <unk> of penguins so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , do you fly <unk> <unk> on the farm , and then you go flying 3 a.m.
do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me , if i was reading a song from chris whitney .
he said , &quot; no . you do this because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> them . i don &apos;t like you .
it &apos;s the <unk> , <unk> taste .
i never bore up with cooking .
and yet , when i tried it in this restaurant , she didn &apos;t taste <unk> at all .
she liked sweet and pure as if you would take a bite of the ocean .
i mentioned that to the <unk> and he was <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin looks like a sponge .
she &apos;s the last violation of something that happens into the body .
it has evolved in evolution by <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added it , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a farm that is successfully measuring their success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , it <unk> enormous , because the water that &apos;s flowing through that farm comes from the stream .
it &apos;s a river that takes all of the things that we &apos;re seeing from rivers today are tendency to lead to chemical pollution , <unk> pollutants .
and if it &apos;s fought through the system , and this leaves , the water is cleaner than it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm to measure their success on their own lives , but a farm that is literally a <unk> , not just for those fish , but for you .
because when the water <unk> , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it to you , because that &apos;s what you want to do , because that love story , as romantic also is also <unk> .
you could say you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one in which food actually actually taste delicious .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a bit too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> ; we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re <unk> .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about local food , we eat food .
and if you claim that these are the things that the future of good foods is somebody somewhere on it and says , &quot; hey people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than only .
one billion people are now starving .
one billion -- this is more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities in terms of poverty .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because she <unk> the logic of the last 50 years .
so crops on crops , <unk> on <unk> , chemicals on earth , chicken on fish , and all of the time the agribusiness has been asked , &quot; if we &apos;re getting more people cheaper , how bad can it be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the business plan .
we should call them what it is , a craft in <unk> , a <unk> , that <unk> <unk> <unk> that allows that production .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> today is threatened by <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through hunting , not by pumps , but through fresh water , not by <unk> , but through forests , not by <unk> and <unk> , but through fish in the ocean .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable each community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in <unk> and it never made a really good food .
so let &apos;s take a look at the ecological model .
this is the two <unk> <unk> <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
businesses that are not worlds for businesses , businesses that are <unk> instead of <unk> , businesses , farmers are growing , instead of <unk> , farmers who are not just being , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts .
and if i &apos;m really honest , it &apos;s a better cook than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the good good food , it &apos;s delicious .
thank you .
if i want to introduce you to you today , it &apos;s the sum of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about it , we want to see how we can make information that we could otherwise be seen .
so what we see here is a typical <unk> model .
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter out a specific cause of death , say , accidents .
and immediately i see a different pattern that makes it happen .
and that is because there are people who are most of the most active , and they &apos;re over here .
we can go out and then move the data and see the data and see that <unk> and cancers are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now if we go down and go back to age , say , 40 years or younger , we see that there &apos;s even the cause of accidents that people should worry about .
and lo and behold , it &apos;s true in men .
so you can see that this is looking at information from data and data in this way , in a sense of swimming .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
so what we &apos;ve got here is the <unk> of every single &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; that have ever printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online online .
you can like to test it in my dorm room .
with <unk> , you can dive into a decade .
you can dive in a particular one year .
you can jump out at a certain piece .
now , if i look around here , i see the athletes that appear in this addresses and the <unk> .
i am a lance armstrong , fan of a book , so i click over here and then show all of my life by lance armstrong .
now , if i just want to see a <unk> , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at the subject ? &quot;
so i go back and take a look at the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that if you put on this type of information , <unk> , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t look or not just not to do it .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
so i want to do this a little bit about what a bit is crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took a single <unk> and put it down to a little summary .
in summary , there &apos;s a brief chart , and a symbol of where it comes from .
i &apos;ll just show the top 500 of the popular s .
but even in that limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are popular on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the government .
well , as i have , in the government , i know that the <unk> are the most powerful time that i think is most of the <unk> of time .
this is really important , because this is a realization that doesn &apos;t put in a single <unk> .
it &apos;s only when you take one step back and look at the whole .
if you look at one particular of these summaries , i can go back to the subject of time , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and they see all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i see that the majority of these are <unk> -- some of you come from science . some , more , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono &apos;s also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and take a look at all the ted prize winner .
you see , we can browse to the web for the first time as if it &apos;s really a web , not just from side , but not more abstract .
and so i want to show you what other little things might be to be .
let me just show you just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it doesn &apos;t really any browser , but you can browse to any websites to each single website , like this .
so i can go back and step directly into a specific <unk> .
and that &apos;s why , because you &apos;re just looking at the web of the way that you see the entire way in the same way you see the same way .
so i can zoom in in a certain time .
here &apos;s the whole thing that i &apos;ve kept thinking about this way .
and i can do everything i &apos;ve been looking at today , again , <unk> .
and , when i take a step back and look at everything , i can rebuild my course , perhaps to look at my course .
and from here , i can go inside the site and get it back to you .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s always used again , and every time it makes the bigger picture than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we talk about the curse of <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head so that instead of walking from one to another , we can begin to go from many things to many things , and by showing that pattern patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do this , this is the <unk> <unk> , maybe a new source of <unk> information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get out of it .
and if we learn to know , then maybe we can pull back out of it .
so i thank you , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my high school , i was driving with the bus every day every day .
and my nose had always been in a book , a <unk> that inspired my thinking in other worlds and <unk> around my <unk> , <unk> curiosity .
this curiosity turned to me that whenever i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests of <unk> , traveled and <unk> , frogs and snakes and bugs , went home and photographed a microscope .
i was completely <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the limits of possible .
and my love of science fiction appeared to reflect in my environment , because then in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our <unk> rooms with his amazing shows that we had animals and places and a world of miracles that we could never imagined before .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s next to this <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because it wasn &apos;t a video games that these movies that were <unk> with movies in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my mind .
we had to do that at that time , when we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and we put them on the canvas on our heads .
my response to this was drawing and paint by aliens , aliens worlds , robots , robots , <unk> and all that .
in the <unk> , i was getting caught away from the teacher , and i was hidden in the textbook .
creativity had to somehow come out .
and something interesting happened , which was what fascinated me to jacques <unk> was the notion of a completely unknown world here on earth .
i &apos;m never going to end an alien world with a spaceship , and it seemed to be quite unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually walk in , on the earth , and she was equally fascinating and exotic as all that i &apos;d imagined when i read these books .
so i decided i was 15 years to be divers .
the only problem is that i lived in a small village in canada , a 3,000 kilometers from the nearest ocean .
and i couldn &apos;t let myself <unk> .
i <unk> my father until he finally had a <unk> <unk> in buffalo , new york , found out on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the pool of <unk> in the field of buffalo in new york .
but the ocean , the real ocean , i just got to face two years later when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , the age of <unk> , i spent about three hours under water , 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , is so rich in ancient sea , as we can &apos;t even imagine .
the wisdom of nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , in contrast to our own , <unk> human imagination .
and for today today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dive .
and my love holds the ocean with the same intensity as ever .
so when i became an adult profession , it was the filmmaking .
that seemed the best way to step out of the inner , to my story , with my need to create images .
as a child , i drew <unk> comic books and so forth .
so , films were made of bringing pictures and stories together . fit together .
of course , the stories that i <unk> around , from the <unk> : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i could take my preference for <unk> and diving together with the theatre .
so , both of my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> , &quot; to try to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- we needed to create a kind of liquid carbon -- we focused on <unk> animation , <unk> , <unk> .
what came out of was the first <unk> <unk> ever seen in a film .
the film doesn &apos;t actually have a money , he said exactly the process that he was doing , but i realized something fascinating : the audience around the world was <unk> by the magic that came out of it .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , you know , <unk> technology , and magic can &apos;t tell them apart .
so you saw something magical .
and i thought that was exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that must be involved in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; next to the next film , even more .
together with <unk> , we built this little made of liquid metal , and the success depended on the way it would hit .
and it worked . again , we created something magical , and the impact in the audience was the same , but we have a little bit more money on the movie .
from these two experiences that came up with a new world , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , with my good friend stan , who was at the time of the best <unk> and <unk> . she was called the digital <unk> .
the basic idea of this company was to start by applying analog processes using visual printers , etc .
and then we did it , and we could have a competitive advantage for this for a while .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that in <unk> and <unk> -- which we actually founded , as we started the company -- started to slow down .
i had this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which was to put the bar into visual effects and <unk> effects in all kinds of realistic heights , with amazing human beings .
but the reputation would go beautiful back , and the people in my company told me that we were not going to be able to do this .
so i did this , and i did this other film about the big ship that &apos;s going to fall .
the <unk> did i say that as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship &quot; sell . it became a <unk> <unk> magnitude , a passionate movie .
but secretly , i really wanted to get the physical <unk> of the titanic .
that &apos;s what i did .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i convinced you by saying , &quot; we go to the wreckage . we film the actual wreck .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
that &apos;s immensely important . it &apos;s a good marketing for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s back back to that your imagination can create a reality .
and then , in fact , we actually created six months later a reality , where i was in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles beneath the ocean of the north atlantic , and i looked at the actual titanic by a <unk> .
it wasn &apos;t a film , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that blew my mind .
and the stakes were enormous . we had to make cameras and lights and everything .
and i noticed how much these <unk> were a similar <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> more comprehensive planning .
you get into this capsule , and you &apos;re floating around into this dark , <unk> environment , where no hope is when you don &apos;t make it yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same way i &apos;d be in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was obsessed with a sense of exploring the deep sea .
anyway , from the part that &apos;s shared with curiosity and science . it was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that i couldn &apos;t give hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i could see outside of the <unk> .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before , and we didn &apos;t even know that words .
so that got me right , and i wanted to get more .
and so i met a sort of unusual decision .
after the success of the titanic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood on a while . &quot;
and then we started to go back to the 1970s , and they explored them with <unk> .
we went back to the wreckage of the titanic .
we took small robots we built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was to <unk> and to look at the inside of the ship that had never been done before .
no one had explored the inside of the <unk> . they didn &apos;t have any resources to do , so we developed the technology .
and i &apos;m sitting there , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see that the <unk> are <unk> like this , which i know that once the band has played there .
and i was flying through a little <unk> by the <unk> of the ship .
i actually think it &apos;s only about , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i &apos;d be involved in the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the <unk> form of a <unk> that i have ever experienced , because before i took a corner , i &apos;d never know about what was going on at the <unk> of the vehicle , because i was going to go around for film .
and the set was actually an accurate copy of the ship &apos;s ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
and she made me realize this <unk> that you use such <unk> <unk> and your own consciousness into the vehicle , into that other form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound .
and maybe a glimpse of what might happen in some decades , what might happen in a few decades , if you &apos;ve got <unk> to do something else or other things , all kinds of <unk> things that i can imagine as a <unk> .
so after these expeditions , we started to see what we saw at the bottom , really , to learn , for example , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , these are kind of alien , but here on earth .
they live with help from <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a basis of sunlight , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right down to a 500 degree centigrade , that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was very , very interested in <unk> , this was the <unk> of my childhood .
and so i ended up talking to the people who are interested in space and have to do with the nasa and sit at the <unk> and <unk> , and they go to russia , the mission of <unk> and all the <unk> and <unk> our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it went out that i took a dive to the deep sea .
i took them up and they gave them access to the world down there : <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in these extreme problems , and i took them to be able to look for the samples and have tools to use instruments and so instruments .
we did a film , but we were doing science , actually , <unk> .
so the circle between my existence was as <unk> , back as a child , and the effort into reality .
and in the course of discovery , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m certainly now thinking that there &apos;s a director of a performer , you have to be a leader , like a <unk> or something .
but i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i did these expeditions .
because at a particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these <unk> movies don &apos;t give us a money .
we &apos;re just playing the cost of progress , of <unk> .
everybody thinks i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have stuck around the nails on a beach on the beach .
i have all these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you do it for the task , the challenge will -- and the ocean is the most vulnerable environment that exists . you make it because of a strange group that &apos;s creating a team together .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have worked for years while we &apos;ve been working on two years into the ocean .
and in this community you realize that the most important thing is the importance that you have once , because you overcome the task that you can &apos;t explain anything else .
when you go back to land and you say , &quot; we had to do this , the <unk> , the <unk> , and all the way around the world , the whole thing .
there &apos;s a link there , a mutually respectful respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership , which is that they were being respected , giving them all the respect . &quot;
and that was really changing the dynamic .
so there i was back with a small team of <unk> terrain , and we filmed &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that we haven &apos;t yet had .
incredibly exciting .
an incredible challenge .
and we went back to a row of four years .
and that changed my way to make movies , completely .
there were people who thought we had really <unk> these <unk> and <unk> on the planet .
for me , it was more sort of an <unk> way to do my job , the real process that changed the outcome .
so what can we conclude from all of that ?
what lessons are we learned ?
i think the first question is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human trait .
our imagination is a force that can create a reality .
and the appropriate word of your team is more important than any of the world .
to me , young filmmakers come to say , &quot; give me a advice about how i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t make you yourself .
the other people get out for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t bet versus yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a <unk> : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art , in exploration , there &apos;s got to be an alternative , because it doesn &apos;t guarantee it there .
not an important endeavor , with innovation , ever challenged .
you have to be willing to take these risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to give you with the way . it &apos;s not an alternative , but fear is not . thank you .
today , i talk to you about energy and climate .
and this may be something like this , because my <unk> project is mainly about vaccines and seeds to make the things that we &apos;re reinventing and deliver to give the poorest two billion people better .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually , more importantly than anyone on the planet .
<unk> means that their retirement communities are not going to grow on a lot of years . we &apos;re too too little or little , and things will change as it can &apos;t protect your invisible environment .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to violence .
so , climate change is going to be terrible for them .
and also , the key thing is very important for them .
in fact , if you could only reduce the price of the price , the energy would be far beyond the most effective system .
well , the <unk> is over the time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> drives the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , we have a rapid fall in the area , and therefore we have <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we can manufacture modern materials and so many things .
so we are in a wonderful situation where we are in the rich world .
but if we &apos;re going to reduce the cost -- let &apos;s get the cost to half -- we meet a new barrier , and it &apos;s linked to co2 .
co2 co2 the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they <unk> the <unk> carbon , which led to the <unk> , and they have a very negative impact on effects , effects on the weather , and perhaps the worse , the <unk> of these ecosystems can &apos;t adapt so that they can &apos;t adapt systems .
well , the exact relationship between a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , and where the other consequences are , there &apos;s some of the questions , but there &apos;s not very many .
and there &apos;s certain ambiguity about how bad those outcomes are going to be , but they &apos;re extremely bad !
i asked the debate several times , &quot; do we really get to get down to the zero ?
don &apos;t it go half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : until we get close to zero , the temperature goes further .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a great challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we have a <unk> <unk> truck that has to be built under a <unk> bridge , and then you can put it back up underneath it .
this one has to go down to zero .
well , we &apos;re going to run a lot of <unk> every year , over 26 billion tons .
every americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
it &apos;s about five tons of all on the planet .
and somehow , we need to make change changes down to zero .
it has been increasing at constant .
there are only different economic changes at all , and we need to go from reducing rise to reduction , and to a reduction in zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to take a zero direction , and that is dependent upon the amount of people on average , and the co2 energy per unit of energy .
so let &apos;s look at each one and we think about how we get it to zero .
probably one of these numbers have to come very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go .
first we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people .
and it goes to nine billion moving forward to the nine billion .
if we do very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> , we could probably reduce it for 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope about 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
that &apos;s all the food that we eat , we dress , clothing , television .
these are very good things , and <unk> means that they have to make it accessible to everyone in the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to do <unk> and use less , but in the average , it &apos;s going to increase all the year and increase all the amount of services than a year .
here we see a very basic service ; there &apos;s a light at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
due to the successes of hiv users , through other <unk> , through new methods in <unk> , there are lots of services , and we have a lot of services on the energy for 90 percent .
in other societies , like <unk> , <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> -- is the amount of improvement for improvement .
overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might have a reduction by a factor of three or maybe even a factor of six .
but for the first three factors , we &apos;re now at 26 billion at some point , probably 13 billion tons .
so let &apos;s take a look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that is costing per unit of energy .
it turns out whether you can get this to zero .
if you burn charcoal : no .
when you burn natural gas : no .
almost every <unk> of current <unk> nowadays , except renewables , and renewables .
so , what we need to do at a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
people have contributed to the development of many of the wonders .
normally there is no deadline that you need a miracle for a second date .
usually you &apos;re just standing next , and some people come .
in this case , we need to get <unk> and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i really get the answer ?
is there a natural natural response , a demonstration that provided the idea of people ?
i remembered that last year , when i got mosquitoes , and some people liked this .
the idea was really useful for them , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , i fell .
i decided that , if my <unk> contribution to my <unk> contribution to the environment .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you &apos;ve told me that you don &apos;t bite , you actually don &apos;t even pick up the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like these , but they don &apos;t all get a lot .
we need solutions , either one or many have a huge amount of scaling and enormous <unk> , and even though there are many ways where people are looking at , i really can only have five to get these big demands .
i have <unk> , <unk> , fusion and <unk> biofuels .
now , you might afford a <unk> contribution and if you expect better than i expect , that would be great , but my point here is that we need to give up to all those five five , and we can &apos;t give them up to them because they have to be told , because they have significant problems .
let &apos;s start looking at fossil fuels at burning by burning by the coal or natural gas .
what you need to do there , it may seem simple , but it &apos;s not . you need to take all the co2 that will come out of the <unk> coming out of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> somewhere , and then somewhere in there .
there are some <unk> , which is going to a 60 percent -- to 80 percent level , but to get it to 100 percent , it &apos;s going to be very difficult , and they have a big problem here &apos;s the challenge .
who &apos;s going to make it ?
who can do something that literally literally will be much bigger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough nut .
next thing .
they have three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries , are very high , and the question for security is that you can really go wrong , despite the collective engagement , the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because although it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three three difficult problems that may be soluble , and to work on that .
the last three five did i put them up .
they &apos;re renewables , as they &apos;re often called .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that they need no fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the density of technologies that produce these dramatically dramatically lower than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> thousand times a thousand power than a normal power station .
and then these sources are <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all the day , it doesn &apos;t seem every single day , and the wind also doesn &apos;t always flow .
and so if you &apos;re dependent on that sources , you have a way to change your energy even in time when you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s great <unk> here . there are challenges of transmission , when we say , for example , the power source of the country is , you don &apos;t just need the technology ; you also need to deal with the risk that the energy from where it comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i have all sorts of batteries that are made , looking at cars , the mobile phones , mobile phones , mobile phone , for example .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be more than 100 times than the approaches to the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you try to tell these <unk> sources about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the use of the use .
if you want to rely on 100 percent on it , you need an incredible <unk> .
well , where should we go . what is the right approach ?
a &quot; project project ? &quot; how are we coming up ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds of them .
in any of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
in many cases they &apos;ll say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in ted , there are a lot of people who are getting in there .
bill big has several companies , including a company called <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of companies making some great things , and interesting ways , and i &apos;m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that may , to surprisingly , is really successful .
there are some innovations in the <unk> , <unk> , liquid .
the evolution has stopped in this industry , i think it &apos;s not a lot of surprise that some good concepts used to use .
the <unk> means that , instead of a part of the <unk> , the one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;d been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never have a physical simulation if it would be done , but since then there are modern <unk> , you can simulate it and see that , yes , with the right <unk> , it looks like it &apos;s functioning .
and because you burn this 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better than that .
in fact , burning the trash , and you can actually use the waste of today to use as <unk> .
instead of breaking down the head , you just burn it . it &apos;s a great thing .
and this is an <unk> <unk> , a little bit like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s a sort of a column , often as a <unk> wave reactor .
that really <unk> the <unk> .
here is a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that &apos;s burned down here , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
the u.s. military headquarters for the hundreds of years .
and if you get inexpensive and cheap <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we measure our success .
what should our record ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve and we talk about it .
many of us talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important to get there .
the rest of 20 percent are going to be produced in poor countries , and still still agriculture . hopefully it can be clean and cement .
so , to get this 80 percent , developing countries developed , including countries like china , changing their <unk> .
the other note says whether we use the <unk> technology whether they &apos;re used in the developed developed world , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is a key part of this project .
if we go back from there , how should it be testimony to the <unk> ?
it should be again to contain the two elements .
we should use the <unk> to try to get down to the bottom , and the less we get the higher , the less becomes the <unk> and also the temperature .
but actually this is the note to the things that we do is not lead to the major <unk> , just equal , or even less less than the other , the speed of innovation for those breakthroughs .
these breakthroughs have to be <unk> with <unk> , and we can measure this : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books on this topic .
al gore &apos;s book , &quot; we have the choice , &quot; david <unk> energy is the hot air .
they &apos;re really going to go through it and create a framework that can be discussed about this , because we need support from all sides .
there &apos;s a lot that needs to be together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very specific wish that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , which is , <unk> <unk> without the co2 is going to take that wish .
this has the biggest effect .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the <unk> is going to be between the long term and <unk> people in the u.s. and china , between the poor and the rich , and all of the lives of that two billion will become very much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what things do i do ?
we need to use for more research .
if countries come together in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you should go through these <unk> , and they would be shocked by just to make these <unk> approaches , for those innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade is something that creates a <unk> .
we need to spread the news .
we need to have dialogue and maintain and the things that are going to be done by government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . in order to understand something better -- first , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do a simulation at a supercomputer , to get all of the great scientists , what we do , we only need a couple of 10 million , and even if we have tested our materials in a russian test to make sure that it works perfectly .
the difficult step is to build the first <unk> , to find more billions , the <unk> and the place that actually built the first of it .
once the first thing is done , as he promised that way , and then it &apos;s all clear because the economy of the energy is as much as usual as we know it .
to really understand that that means deep to build up in the ground almost like a vertical column of nuclear <unk> , which is <unk> , and then the process goes up and continued to work down ?
<unk> : right . today , you &apos;ve got to <unk> the reactor now , so there are many people and a lot that we can go wrong . this thing where you open it and it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> . that &apos;s not good .
if you have very cheap fuel , you can drill it for 60 years -- think about a column -- that she buried , without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it burns 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , which is a solution for the trash .
<unk> : yeah . now what happens to the trash : you can sit it -- there &apos;s a lot less waste from this method -- you take it and put it in the next reactor and you burn it .
and we start by taking the waste that exists already in the <unk> or <unk> of reactors , which is our <unk> .
so this is what these reactors have been a problem , which is what we fill in our setting and so dramatically reduce this process dramatically .
but while they &apos;ve talked to these different people around the world .
where is the greatest interest in what this really is ?
<unk> : well , we haven &apos;t yet set up a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting <unk> for everything that &apos;s called nuclear , &quot; there &apos;s huge interest , and the people in the company were in russia , india , china , china -- and i talked about how this fits to the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and the japanese did something in the direction .
this is an alternative version of the thing that was made .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster nuclear reactor , and some countries have built this , so that everybody has done a rapid test of the first one , for example , for the first one .
in your mind , time and chance you really want to respond to your life ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve created 20 years to invent and then 20 years .
so that &apos;s kind of the deadline that gives us the <unk> that we have to follow .
and , you know , <unk> , when everything goes well , and that &apos;s a great wish , that could make it easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of people , the way that their trials work for their pilots to work on for those pilots .
and it would be best when they can do it , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
what is the great possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
it would have been without the <unk> , but it does even more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the modular method , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> , which seems a little difficult to do , but maybe we say something about us .
and so there are different , but the nice thing about this is that a <unk> has a huge amount of energy like a matter of what we &apos;re talking about , and therefore , if you can handle the problems , and the cost , the impact of the country and other things , almost in a <unk> league .
if it doesn &apos;t happen , what then ?
do we need to leap in order to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : once you come into this situation , it &apos;s like you eat too much , and you &apos;re standing in front of a heart attack . what does you do ? you might need a <unk> or something like that .
there &apos;s a <unk> map called <unk> , which is associated with various techniques to stop the warming , so we would be given for 20 or 30 years to get to us .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t work in the insurance , because you might be lazy to keep your food , because you know that you will save a <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you think about the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in <unk> whether it &apos;s available , whether it &apos;s going to get faster , or that will require that more than we expect .
<unk> : do you have one or two sentences for you to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are very different types of camps .
the ones that make scientific arguments are very little .
tell you that there &apos;s negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are going to move things ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell , in which there will be a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is something like this .
you make the mistakes now , and you pay the amount to you .
and so , the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of <unk> problems to invest in something that you just came up to , you know , what you &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s where the investment has not been so clear . and indeed , the ipcc report does not necessarily be the worst event .
the fact is that this uncertainty is supposed to worry about .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically , and then the co2 emissions , then the co2 emissions , then i say , &quot; well , i don &apos;t want to accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the most compelling argument that when you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals is , you know , the <unk> goals of resources , to invest money , where we have things better .
<unk> : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should be spending 10 billion a year than today today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
none of these things don &apos;t suffer .
you get to big <unk> , and there can be <unk> <unk> people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic economic , and it &apos;s trying to fund it . i &apos;m going to do that most of you .
because , you know , it &apos;s very short , a <unk> , and you &apos;re just going to fund the learning curve , and i think we should try to try to try to try and do some things that are the potential to be very much cheaper .
if the <unk> you get , a very high <unk> , it can only keep the rich .
i mean , each of us here can be spending five times so much for our energy without changing their lifestyle .
for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> itself .
his new <unk> is now : &quot; why won &apos;t research on more research ? &quot;
it still continues , because of their earlier stories , associated with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and therefore he gets the <unk> .
and that &apos;s a guy that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little is supporting it .
bill , i think i &apos;m going to talk to almost every person here , when i say , i really hope your wish is true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a couple of years ago , at ted , peter <unk> came a <unk> called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . let &apos;s have to have the greatest maximum structure with the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a <unk> .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and , even though it seems really easy , it &apos;s really hard , because it drives people very quickly to work together .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i was turning it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops in the world with students , engineers and architects and architects , even with <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s something about this task that allows deep information to work and i want to share some of them with them .
normally , most people start to orient themselves into the task .
they talk about it , think about what it is like to make it <unk> .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they <unk> books .
they spend a lot of their time in <unk> .
and finally , before you don &apos;t have time , you take the marshmallow , and you put it gently on the top , step back back , and step back up .
but then , almost always , it &apos;s going to be something called &quot; <unk> &quot; to a <unk> , because that weight is changing , because the whole thing is going to bend and <unk> .
there are a number of people who have much more <unk> , as others , and under the <unk> are fresh <unk> .
they lie , they &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re confused and producing real <unk> shapes .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more <unk> , and under the best of graduate students are <unk> .
and this is quite amazing .
as we told peter did not only make the top towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is : how does this happen ? why ? what about ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the kids spend a lot of money in the spaghetti sauce . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> are being trained to find a proper plan , ok .
and then they realized .
what happens when you put the marshmallow up , you don &apos;t have time to have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what makes other difference is that they start with the marshmallow and build , prototypes , <unk> prototypes , always <unk> with the marshmallow at the top so that they can <unk> the prototype prototypes .
<unk> , these types of collaboration as a core of a collaboration .
and with every trial , the children immediately get feedback , what &apos;s going on .
so the performance of working with prototypes , a lot -- but let &apos;s see how different teams are acting .
the average average for most of us is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , lawyers have more , but not much better , better than the adults .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
one is the highest i saw .
and why ? because they understand the triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
ceos are talking about average . but it &apos;s going to be interesting .
you put a <unk> administrator at the team , you &apos;re significantly significantly better .
it &apos;s amazing . you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is this ?
because they have special skills skills .
they conduct the process , they understand it .
and the team that regulate policing , and the work will get significantly significantly the performance of the team significantly significantly .
specialized skills and <unk> and their <unk> lead to success .
if they have 10 teams , they &apos;re going to be typical , they get about six of the strong structures .
i was trying to do something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s bring the <unk> .
so i offered a $ <unk> prize for software to the winner .
what do you think about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had built a high high construction , he would have carried the price home .
so is it not interesting that high performance has a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same student .
so what do you think ?
now , they understood the benefit of rapid prototyping .
so , the same thing is made of the same bad one .
they produced the highest construction at the least time .
so there are <unk> lessons for us , about nature &apos;s incentive and success .
you may ask : why would you actually spend time to create a <unk> , right ?
the reason is , i &apos;m going to help digital tools and processes to make teams to create teams , video games , video games and <unk> .
and what the <unk> does is , they help them identify hidden hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge gives a common experience , a shared language , and a stance of building the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this kind of simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , can be <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
they &apos;re going to find crazy examples from all around the world like people to optimize the system and build it .
there are also <unk> .
and the lesson lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport .
it requires that all of our senses on our task , and that we think our way to use optimal , like our emotions and our work , in the challenge that we are .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience everything you need to take us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; to &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s pretend we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine , and this is a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to be in .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay here right now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter , &quot; america is the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe that you &apos;re kind of drawn to <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past and not because i &apos;m a adventurers .
it &apos;s because the way on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so , i want to be in this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that existed in the planet , no matter how scale they would like , health , wealth , mobility , opportunity , declining <unk> .
there was never time before this .
my <unk> died all of them than they were 60 .
my grandparents were <unk> that number on <unk>
my parents are the 80 .
so there should be better at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who &apos;s born today in new delhi will expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox , smallpox had billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve molded the demographics of the earth in a way that no film has ever done .
they are gone . they are gone .
we <unk> them . <unk> .
in the rich world there are diseases that millions of us only have been threatened by a generation , even though .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody know what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are the successes of the scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is trying to see things if it works , it will change it , if it doesn &apos;t do , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements , we have a billion people in this world every day to be hungry .
this number goes up , and it goes up very quickly , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we have used our imagination to <unk> this world .
drinking water , tropical land , rainforests , rainforests , gas , gas , disappear , and if we &apos;re not going away from that chaos , we &apos;re going to disappear .
so the question is : can we do this ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live to rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that they are not destroying the same simultaneously .
i really believe that , and no , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is my wake up at night -- one of the things that lie to me awake at night , and we haven &apos;t needed scientific even more now .
and we &apos;ve never been able to make it reasonable <unk> , as we can .
we are at the brink of amazing , amazing events in many places , and yet i really think that we have to go back to the history of 300 years before we have to deal with these things more strong , more than more than now .
people are clinging to their faith in their own life , so they can &apos;t free it .
not the truth is going to free it .
and listen , everybody has a right to look at it ; even one is based on its mind , progress .
but do you know what you &apos;re not right ?
they don &apos;t have a matter of their own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t .
and i needed a while to figure it out .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about vaccination for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed at hitting resistance , on resistance towards what &apos;s most effective in the end of the most effective operation in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did whatever i was doing , i wrote a paper and i continued .
and shortly after that , i wrote an article about genetically modified food .
the same thing , only greater .
people were playing crazy .
so i also wrote about this article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought it would be , &quot; why they believed that molecules on a particular event was a random type of <unk> to the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we make a rich , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but this paper made me worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and then i found it .
and that &apos;s because these people who made me crazy , not just hate people .
these were <unk> people , intellectual people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that made me so mess .
but then i thought , well , you know what .
we &apos;re at the point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress as we used .
we talk about it .
we talk about ironic with little quotes : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s the reason for that , and i think we are , what are these reasons .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science and lost to us , and there &apos;s no reason why it should be .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , mass destruction , weapons of mass destruction , the <unk> <unk> .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we thought they &apos;d always be right . so they were skeptical .
ask yourself , demand an evidence , ask a evidence .
don &apos;t think about anything .
but now it &apos;s going to be : if you have the evidence to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say this from the reason that we &apos;re living in an epidemic of dread , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully will never see again .
about 20 years ago , a story published , a terrible story that <unk> the infection associated with measles , <unk> and <unk> vaccine .
very scary .
there are thousands of studies have been done to see if that was true .
there are lots of studies to be done ; it &apos;s a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all right , no relationship , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see what we see in what we believe , what causes us to feel .
we don &apos;t believe on a group of documents that are giving us data , and i understand that , i think we &apos;re all doing that .
but you know what ?
the result of that was devastating .
in fact , catastrophic disease , in the fact that the united states is one of the only countries in the world , which is the <unk> for measles .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s horrible .
what happened is that we could do this .
well , i understand . i do .
because anybody here ?
is one of the audience in the audience who ever see someone dying ?
not very often happens .
in this country , not in the country , even 0.2 of the world last year .
these are many deaths from measles , 20 20 per hour .
but because this isn &apos;t happening here , we can <unk> it , and people like jenny <unk> can walk around and be heard of fear and illiteracy from platforms like tv and larry king live .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t link between connection and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something we need to learn , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , vanished .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just developed with a couple of other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s good , besides that , walking around and talking about vaccines , and says , how valuable you are , and that people simply stopped listening .
and he actually says that way .
now , paul is a terrorist .
when paul talks in a public <unk> , he can &apos;t tell the <unk> of <unk> .
he gets phone calls , because people like to tell him they know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul has a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
so take you back , go back to the disease , horrible diseases , and this is happening .
we now have measles in this country .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die again because this is just a question of paying .
and they &apos;re not just dying of cells .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
one of a sudden i wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said that i &apos;m a little bit of <unk> .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t kill your child against <unk> <unk> . no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> . and you know ?
we had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe on the morning this guy in lagos , and she &apos;s going to fly out on los angeles , right now , he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a couple of hours , he lands and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;ll visit this one day of this evening .
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a disease disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works .
this is the planet that we live in . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to <unk> ourselves . we love this .
did you all take your vitamins every morning .
<unk> , a small <unk> , that helps you keep folding .
i know you &apos;ve done this because half the americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative to cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference how often we find out they &apos;re useless .
the data proves that all the time .
they <unk> their urine . they never do it .
that &apos;s okay , they want to pay 28 billion dollars in the urine .
i agree with them .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why are we doing this ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t trust trust .
and we shouldn &apos;t . we have our healthcare system .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> itself to us who can afford it .
so we &apos;re running before , and where are we running ?
we &apos;re running into the poor of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really serious serious , because the stuff is crap , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars .
and i have all kinds of <unk> <unk> .
none of it -- <unk> , cheating , cheating , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars from it .
and you know what ? when i say that , people are telling me and saying , &quot; what is it ? do people do what they want .
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> , it says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to accept the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any <unk> who is trying to treat his patient with surgery .
if you &apos;re going to go on this path where religions and magic evidence and replacing science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he took 400,000 of his people because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know is that you can get the progression of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that gets worse than any other disease of that disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have any consequences .
they have them . they always have .
now , the <unk> epidemic in which we are right now , this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> genetically engineered <unk> and <unk> foods .
this is a <unk> debate . she has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every branch of <unk> , each branch , has changed from people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did all this .
we &apos;ve done it for the last 10 years .
and some of it has worked , and some of it doesn &apos;t happen .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it , and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and that stuff can be millions of people , to bring their lives up .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we <unk> genetically changed .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m always hearing is : lots of chemicals , pesticides , <unk> , hormones , we don &apos;t want to huge numbers with a thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what &apos;s my answer to all of this ?
yes , they &apos;re right . fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but it &apos;s not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes not , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we fear fear is a dead <unk> , and it causes millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we need to grow 70 percent more food than the moment is 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it .
and why ? genetically modified food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like <unk> .
cassava is something that half a billion people are eating .
it &apos;s about a potato .
it &apos;s just a calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all this in it .
and then people could eat the food and not going to be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say to this is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , ask us why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to add genes .
it &apos;s not about gene genes . it &apos;s not about any chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our footprint on greater food , better nutrition , sustainable food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s really time to understand what it means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we continue to do so far as we do so far as we do , we believe we don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s selfish ; it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our , and we have to stop it .
so after this incredibly fun conversation , you want to say , &quot; well , do you want this kind of <unk> machine and go to the future ? &quot;
anyway , i want that anyway .
right now , it &apos;s in the present moment , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can do this time machine on what we want .
we can <unk> them , where we want them to go , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but when we go into the world machine and go to the future , we will be happy to have done .
i know we can do it , and as far as it affects me , is something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a time , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> , and it might seem strange that a magician was interested in it , because they &apos;re looking at it as i like , &quot; an illusion that is really being true when somebody believes there . &quot;
in other words , in <unk> , in some studies , we have shown it &apos;s an measurable effect , which is because of that sense , because the person thinks it &apos;s happening , whether you have a patient , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body that you call the <unk> .
a delusion is being benign , because somebody feels like that .
so in order to understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has been at least since the 1950s , for the 1950s .
i &apos;ve learned it from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , see what happens .
the knife that you can look at , of my hand that you can study .
i &apos;m going to hold the knife to stay in my fists .
i push my sleeves .
and to make sure there &apos;s nothing going on in my sleeve or coming out of it , i just just put my wrist down here .
in this way , you can see that nobody &apos;s going to move on anything , and as long as i go there , there can &apos;t go into my sleeves and get out of it .
and the goal is really simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully when everything is good , the knife is held by using my bare physical magnetism .
it actually is so tightly on the place that i can shake it without a knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or come out , no <unk> , and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often find a few kids who are interested in magic , because you can see a lot about deception when you look at them , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
you know , many of you here in the auditorium this trick .
and it works like this .
i grab the knife in my hand .
i say that i &apos;m putting my wrist on to make sure that nothing goes on my sleeve , or it comes out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason why i <unk> my wrist , is that there is the secret of the illusion .
now , in the moment , when i put my hand out of you , so you can see it from the back , this one here &apos;s going to be here , my <unk> , just from where he was , in a position where it was so <unk> .
great trick ?
the back is somebody who didn &apos;t have a childhood .
so , it &apos;s here . right .
and when i <unk> , the fingers does its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that here are just three fingers in the bottom : because the mind and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three , but it &apos;s as a group .
but this is really nothing about this , and then i open my hand .
of course it &apos;s stuck there , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now .
and when i close my hand , the same thing that happens when i leave you , it will be hidden through that movement that the finger put back again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
you can do this trick for your friends , and your piano . thank you .
now , what does that have to do with the <unk> ?
one year ago , i read a study that really drives me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and so that &apos;s an amazing thing to me .
and what it turns out is : if you offer a placebo in the <unk> of the white pill , in the form of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular measurable effect .
but if you put the shape in which you give the placebo , it can change in a smaller pill , and that color blue , and you see it blue , you &apos;re actually measured more effective .
and that , even none of those <unk> -- they &apos;re just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? so i really freak out .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
when you take capsules , it &apos;s more effective than pills and any form .
a colored capsule , which is at the end of the yellow , and the other red is better than a white capsule .
the ingredient plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is .
... the role games play a role .
and the shape is playing a role .
and if you want to make the ultimate <unk> , you have to grab your needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a couple of <unk> substance with a <unk> substance that you inject a patient .
this creates a very powerful picture . it &apos;s very much more than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a projection .
so the fact that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule doesn &apos;t seem as well as the needle .
and none of it has some really unique property . it &apos;s just our belief that it has made a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i suppose it &apos;s a deception , obviously , and make it look real .
we know from the study that you need to grab your needle when it &apos;s going to go .
this is a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;ll just explain it a little bit of a little bit .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not a nice strange <unk> of meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;m going to take this needle in my skin and draw through them through the other hand .
if you &apos;re <unk> , if you drop out -- you have a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and it has become a woman almost powerless .
so i &apos;m going to suggest that if you &apos;re going to be <unk> , you look for the next 30 seconds , or you can see , i &apos;m going to do the very difficult part here in the back .
you can see it , you can also see if you want it .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat is going on , at the lower part of my arm , i &apos;m going to just make a small <unk> .
i &apos;m so sorry . do you crazy ?
and now just put a little bit through my skin and on the other hand .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had the <unk> .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my finger , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yes .
i know what people think when they see .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not so stupid , and <unk> himself the skin , just to give us a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like here ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back said , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that . &quot;
people in the <unk> are coming in .
let me show you a little closer to you .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can <unk> the <unk> .
sorry . if you &apos;re <unk> , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
the people in the back , who , at some time , see this video , will say , &quot; well , that &apos;s pretty impressive , but if it was real , it would be -- it &apos;s a hole and it was going to bleed . &quot;
okay , let me take a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
i normally would take the needle now .
i would clean up my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think , in this frame here , with the purpose of making something real real , i &apos;m going to just get the needle in there and go on the stage .
we &apos;re going to see a few times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy this . thank you .
everyone talks about happiness .
i have some people counting the number of books that we have with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title five years , and they picked up about 40 .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of happiness in happiness .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would love to make people happier .
but despite all of the tide that work , there are multiple cognitive times that they &apos;re almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly about these cognitive <unk> .
this is true for <unk> , thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists , thinking about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just as confused as any other .
the first of these is to be a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is not a useful word , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could only divide it , but in large , and this is something we need to give up , and we will take the complicated view of what is well-being .
the second case is to experience experience and memory : in fact , there are basically between being in his life and being happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third one is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a sense of well-being about well-being , without its significance .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive case .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> , after one of my lectures , who said a story -- &#91; unclear &#93; said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful art , and it was at the end of the recording , a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then he added it , really , very emotional , that has ruined all the experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it would have been the experience of experience .
he had had experience .
he had had 20 minutes of <unk> music .
they didn &apos;t , because he was a memory memory , it was ruined , and memory was everything that he had to get .
what really tells us is that we can think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and the presence of the presence , capable of experiencing the past , but only has the present .
it &apos;s the most <unk> self that physician <unk> -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt if i &apos;m going to hurt you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is that the <unk> and the story of our life <unk> , and it &apos;s that the doctor asks us to ask the question , &quot; how did you feel like that lately ? &quot;
or , like , the journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self , and the <unk> self , and to be both the part of the strangeness of the happiness .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and that really starts to start with a basic response response to our memories -- it &apos;s beginning to happen .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we tell ourselves stories .
our memory tells us stories that means what we &apos;re going to keep in our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who are doing a painful procedure .
i won &apos;t go into detail . she &apos;s not more painful today , but she was painful for the early 1990s .
they were asked to tell them every 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of those have suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has been more <unk> . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain that had a patient has a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how did it think that patients were suffering from ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patients got a much worse worse than the patient b epidemic .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories are very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is significantly worse than the other .
and the one that was worse , where the pain was at the peak at its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to their <unk> , and they said , &quot; how bad was the whole ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct conflict between the self and the <unk> self .
from a point of view of the self , b has even worse times .
now , what you could do with the a person , and we actually did clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually get the <unk> of a patient by just a way to shake the tube without it .
this is going to lead to the patient who &apos;s suffering , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have that the <unk> self has worse to do a patient &apos;s disease , and you have that the <unk> self is much better at the end , because now you have a patient a a better story about his experience .
what brings up a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that memory us , and it &apos;s true for the stories we invent .
what a story is <unk> , dramatic moments and ends .
so , very , very important , and this is the end of the end .
well , the <unk> self is alive lives .
it has moments of <unk> , one after another .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most of our lives -- and i have this -- they know the psychological presence than about three seconds , which means you know , there are about 600 million of them . in a month there &apos;s about 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave .
most of them are completely ignored by the <unk> self .
and yet , you kind of get the impression that you should count , that what happens during those moments of life .
it &apos;s the limited resource we use as we are in the world .
and as we use them to be seemingly important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> self .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is about time .
from view of the <unk> self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is exactly as good as the first one is the <unk> vacation as long as the holidays .
that &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work for itself .
for example , the <unk> self is a <unk> <unk> <unk> than any <unk> vacation , because there are no new memories .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , time is the critical one , which is the critical one that &apos;s a different self from a <unk> self , time has very little impact on this story .
now , the <unk> self is starting to remember and to tell stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , who says we had two <unk> of two degrees of <unk> and decides to choose what the choice is , which is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who will choose .
the <unk> self has no voice in that choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between stories . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future than anything .
we think about our future as <unk> memories .
and basically , you can see this , you know , as a tyranny of the self , and you can think of yourself as an idea that &apos;s sort of thinking about the self as an experience that doesn &apos;t need the <unk> self .
i have the impression that when we &apos;re traveling , this is a lot of the case , which is , we &apos;re doing vacations , largely in the service of the <unk> self .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much <unk> we memories of our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that is responsible for the dominance of the <unk> itself .
and when i think about it , i think about a holiday that we &apos;ve done on a couple of years ago in the course that i &apos;ve ever had , and i think , has often been in relation to how much i often think about it .
and i probably have from my memories of this archive , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
well , if i ever had the public <unk> with the 600 pictures there i had one more hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s about five and a half hours .
there seems to be a disagreement .
now , i may be a little bit , really , you know , how little appetite i have on your memory of memory , but even if you have more of it , there &apos;s a real question , why do we give memories of so much weight in the amount of life that we have experiences ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know , at the end of the <unk> , you &apos;ve lost all the pictures , and you get a <unk> drug so you don &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between the two types of self , and you have to think about how they decide that conflict , and that &apos;s really not quite obvious , because if you think of the sense of time , you get an answer .
so why we pick up the <unk> , which we choose is a problem that turns us with a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two species of themselves are <unk> two terms of happiness .
in fact , there are really two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per single one .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the life of itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- fortunately for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re now capable of getting a pretty good idea of happiness by the time .
if you &apos;re lucky enough to ask yourself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not how happy a person is alive .
it &apos;s how happy or happiness is the person when you think about your life .
very different term .
anyone who &apos;s not unlike these terms of exploring the happiness of happiness , and i &apos;m a part of a lot of researchers about the living of happiness that have been exploring the happiness of happiness , in that same way .
the distinction between the happiness of the self and the happiness of the self has been realized , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the gallup organization has a worldwide poll that has spent more than a million people asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve learned how to learn about the two types of self .
and the main lesson we have , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy with his life is , and it doesn &apos;t really tell you how much he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation between the correlation that is correlation .
what that means is that if you hit someone , and you would tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about your size ?
well , you &apos;d know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much insecurity .
when i tell you that somebody &apos;s life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> self .
so the correlation is very low .
we know something about what happiness happiness .
we know that money is very important , goals is very important .
we know happiness means mainly to be satisfied with people with us that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize happiness in both of the self , you &apos;ll want to do very different things .
so the implication of what i said here is that we really don &apos;t want to consider happiness as an replacement for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different notion .
now , very briefly , another reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness , is that we &apos;re paying attention to the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy the people in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask that question , you think that the people in california are going to be happy if they say we &apos;re in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is very important for the self of the self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
but , because the responsibility is responsible for , they can end up -- -- some people could go off to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who go to california to become happier in hope .
well , your <unk> self will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you will think you &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to be reminded of how dreadful the weather in ohio was and you will feel that you have made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , when we talked about a couple of weeks , i was talking to myself that there was a pretty interesting conclusion that came out of this gallup poll .
is this something you can let us do , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is a number we didn &apos;t expect to do .
we found that in terms of happiness .
when we looked at how emotions vary .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a very representative sample of a $ 20,000 dollar a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are people unhappy , and they become more happy , and the poorer they are .
we &apos;re going to get a completely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw these flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money doesn &apos;t take a <unk> , but that lack of money , surely , we &apos;re <unk> , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , they get another story .
the more money you make more <unk> .
it &apos;s not true .
but danny , in the entire american devotion to live , liberty , the pursuit of happiness .
when people take this seriously seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything in the head , everything we believe , for example , on <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians in the country would think more generally like <unk> , and based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think it &apos;s the recognition for the role of interest in politics .
the recognition is going to be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it happens right now , and in other countries it &apos;s going to happen .
people are willing to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about politics .
it will take a while , and people will debate whether they want to explore research or whether they want to be exploring <unk> , so we have to have this discussion quite a long time .
how you increase happiness can get very different depending on how you think and think about yourself thinking about yourself or thinking about yourself .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you <unk> up to measure the population of the population .
that &apos;s what i think , in the next one or two decades is part of the national statistics .
now , it seems to me , this is going to be , or at least the most exciting political debate to pursue it over the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i have evolved now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy for the world to save the world in order to save them in <unk> .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of time to play with more and more and play games .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you might think , &quot; well , this is a whole amount of time for games . &quot;
maybe a little bit of time when you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
in fact , my research on the institute of the future , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough enough to solve the most difficult problems in the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically decrease that time .
i &apos;ve calculated that it takes over time for 21 billion hours a week .
and it seems to be a little bit more interesting , so , again , again , i can think it can act like this : when we solve problems like famine , poverty , climate change , global health issues , obesity .
no , i &apos;m really kidding .
why ? this picture tells me quite precisely why i believe that games are so essential for survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a tudor photographer of photographers .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he made the camera up with the players .
this is one of the three expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not gamers , you may have some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , a fear , but it &apos;s also heightened concentration at a very difficult problem .
if you also play , you see some <unk> here , looking up at the top of the eyes , and your mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show show surprise .
this is a player standing on the edge of a so-called <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . so , so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that is so positive that they didn &apos;t know what it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and when they get it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually capable of being able to do this . this is a victory victory .
this player is just a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces around all over the world , when we take the rise of the next century , and the face of those , are facing the edge of the <unk> edge .
well , unfortunately , we see more like this face in real life when we face problems .
i call it &quot; life in &quot; i am bad , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , see ? yeah . ok .
that &apos;s me , as i am , &quot; i am bad at life . &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i examined in my ph.d. why are in the process of life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think that we are not as good as it is in play .
and i don &apos;t just do that even successful , even though that is .
we &apos;re going to achieve something more . i mean , in my relationship with motivation , to do something more powerful , inspired by working together .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i believe that many of us are turning into our best version and anytime , and immediately be willing to try to solve the problem as long as it takes to try and try to take it again .
and in reality , when we fail in obstacles , we feel often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we face us . we feel threatened , we feel depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
and i don &apos;t have these feelings when we play games , they &apos;re just not going to play it .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible for games to think , couldn &apos;t just do it all ?
how can we put these feelings from reality in reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment for a creative problem .
and i &apos;ve found some things that can play in epic <unk> in such as possible .
so , first , if you go into one of these <unk> , particularly in world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters who are willing to give you a <unk> mission , and immediately it .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly at your present level , right ?
so they do it .
you never get one task you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their capabilities , so you have to get a job , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and spin <unk> , there &apos;s always important to do something important .
and there are lots of collaborators .
where they &apos;re going to go , hundreds of thousands of people working together with their mission mission .
we don &apos;t have that life in the real life , that feeling that there are a lot of staff waiting at all .
and there &apos;s also this epic narrative story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we &apos;ll get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve driven by &quot; rise and &quot; + &quot; <unk> , &quot; or &quot; + &quot; <unk> . &quot;
this constant feedback there is not in true life .
when i leave that stage , i don &apos;t have a talk , + + talking a + idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get real feedback in this real life .
so , the problem of <unk> like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be on the edge of a cliff , that we prefer to spend our entire time in these days .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
by today , all of the world of <unk> spent <unk> millions of years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
it &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it might be <unk> .
but to see it in the context , before millions of years ago , we started to walk upright first .
so , the first <unk> .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend time play , it only makes sense , when you think about time on the scale of human development , is extraordinary .
but also , if it turns out , because it turns out we &apos;re going to use these kinds of time , to actually change what we are as people are capable of .
we develop a collaborative community , <unk> .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
if you look at this interesting statistic recently recently by a researcher of carnegie mellon students , the average boy of a year with <unk> <unk> spends 10,000 hours of <unk> to age 21 .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number .
first of all , for kids in the united states , they spend their <unk> hours that they spend in school , from the five grade until the high school class -- if you don &apos;t get missing .
so we have a complete <unk> here , to the young people , as well as it means to be a good player , like everything else , what you &apos;re learning in school .
and maybe some of you have this new book by malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know , his theory of success , the theory of success , 10,000 years .
it &apos;s based on the great science of <unk> that , if we spend 10,000 hours with a subject with the subject age at the age of age at the age of age , we will begin to master .
we &apos;re going to be so good at whatever , as the most famous people in the world .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are gamers like that ? &quot;
because if we could find that , we would have never had the potential human potential .
so many people are currently working on the world at least one hour per day .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are remarkably good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion people who are extraordinary in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it .
the <unk> developed , saving energy , working on <unk> , rather than the <unk> , with players around the world , especially in india , in brazil , brazil .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have a total of 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is to do to make these sorts of games .
here &apos;s the four things that i found . first of all , <unk> .
ok , think of this as extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do something immediately , to overcome a hurdle , with the faith that we have a good hope of success .
players always believe that an iranian victory is possible , and it &apos;s worth worth trying to do it , and it &apos;s equal .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters of spiders denser dense social networks .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that show that people like this , as we played with them , even when they &apos;re <unk> us .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play a game .
we trust that somebody will spend with us that the rules are going to be <unk> , that we have the same goal and we keep staying with it .
so the ability to create growth of ties , trust and each other .
as a result , we put more stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s one reason why the <unk> of <unk> takes a week , as a result of a <unk> .
the reason is , when we play , we &apos;re actually getting happier than work when we relax and not do anything .
we know that as human beings are perfect , if we do hard , difficult work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right job .
and ultimately , epic matter .
players love to be able to be part of the <unk> of missions of magnitude .
here &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s going to go back to the right light . you definitely know wikipedia , the largest wikipedia in the world .
the second biggest wikipedia in the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information over the world of warcraft on the internet than any other subject in any other <unk> of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a <unk> source of the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single result . players are hopeful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real ones .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we will see death from less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and this is an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i do -- i develop games , i &apos;m a <unk> .
so he says , that really makes sense , because players can achieve in more meaningful than they live in real life .
they can make their social social bonds as they live in real life . they get more feedback and reward rewards as they live in real life .
so , he says , well , it &apos;s completely logical that gamers are more time in the virtual world than in real time .
i &apos;ll only agree with that . that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to start transforming the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event called 2,500 years .
you have these ancient cube , from <unk> . do you know ?
before these amazing <unk> came up with <unk> .
and these were kind of kind of <unk> people .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of ancient greek <unk> <unk> , you may know this story , and the story of how it was invented .
according to games , games were <unk> , <unk> , in the kingdom of <unk> during famine .
it was such a great famine that king of parliament turned into a crazy idea .
the people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> a national strategy , and a day they would eat . the next day , you would play .
and they would be so deeply immersed in the <unk> , because games are so fascinating , and we surrounded with <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day , you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , they survived this famine as they ate in a day and they were playing the next one .
likewise , i think we play games today .
we play games to escape the real world .
we &apos;re playing games to solve everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , most real life is not satisfying , and we get the one that we need to play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to the age of 18 years , famine years was not better , so the king , a final <unk> <unk> .
they divided the kingdom in two .
they played a <unk> and the <unk> allowed to get an <unk> adventure .
they went out and went out looking for a new home , so they had so many people coming back to the way that was needed food , and looking for the rest of an area where they could thrive .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest latest show shows that the <unk> <unk> , which then emerged the roman empire , the same type of dna as the ancient <unk> .
so scientists have recently thought that <unk> crazy story is true .
and geologists found evidence of a global <unk> , which could almost explain the famine .
so this might be a crazy story .
maybe they actually saved their people through games by having 18 years in games , and then they had these <unk> , and so many of the other people , they learned that they would save the entire civilization .
so , we can .
we &apos;ve played warcraft since 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real time in the world of <unk> . this was 16 years ago .
they played <unk> for 18 years , we &apos;ve invented warcraft .
i want to argue , we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so they sent half of their civilization looking for a new world , so i take my 21 billion <unk> <unk> per week .
we should be involved in half the time that half of us have to play with an hour a day with until we solve the world &apos;s problems .
i know you &apos;re going to say , &quot; how do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot; and this particular question , i &apos;ve been working on the institute for the future for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto it expresses how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible outcome , and then empower people to make this notion of reality .
we &apos;re going to win wins , and we give people the opportunities to achieve it .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly about three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to get people &apos;s gains in their own future .
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> that you have to overcome a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> to make it realistic , and it will be real life without life . so if they &apos;re going to be <unk> , they &apos;ll be <unk> .
we &apos;ve tested this game with 87 players in 2007 . and we &apos;ve been accompanied it over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an augmented experience .
nobody wants to change its life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure and said , &quot; we &apos;re the oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure to go on .
find out how they survive , and most of our players have <unk> their <unk> habits .
so , for the next time , we &apos;ve got a bigger , broader goal than just to do that .
we have the game called &quot; <unk> &quot; the institute for the future .
it &apos;s starting about computation for the point of thinking that people only have 40 years on the planet .
this is a supercomputer called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; of course .
the call on players , sign up , we have almost like <unk> <unk> .
you know , jerry <unk> , where there is the &quot; <unk> &quot; -- you have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and only they can save the world .
but in our play , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , security , the future of social justice .
8,000 players playing the same eight weeks .
they found 500 incredible creative solutions that they can read when they google &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we put in front of march three . it &apos;s a game in partnership with the world bank .
when you finish the game , you &apos;re going to get the award in &quot; global <unk> , &quot; <unk> .
we work with universities across the sub-saharan africa and store them to learn social .
we have a comic here . we have a level of <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision and <unk> .
i want to invite you all , to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in <unk> countries that benefit from their own social enterprises to save the world .
so i &apos;ll come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think you &apos;re next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we don &apos;t save the real world yet .
well , i hope you &apos;ll agree with you that are gamers for resources that we can use in real life , and that games play a big meaning for change .
we have these whole <unk> , <unk> productivity , the ability to engage strong social nets , <unk> and desire for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing great games to survive on this planet for another century .
and i hope you &apos;ll play this game and play like this .
when i go back to the next decade , i &apos;m sure at two things that we can create any future future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the launch games .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what i was talking about was writing a article at the article of a wired article .
i used to write my <unk> at the time , but i was working with the edit of writing , and i noticed that i never ever had in my life , which means the word &quot; disabled &quot; .
i read the post .
&quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> : &quot; <unk> , helpless , useless , destroyed , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : healthy , strong , powerful .
i read this list a friend saying , and she had to laugh , and it was so ridiculous , but i just came up to &quot; <unk> , &quot; and he had to stop reading , and then i had to get out of these <unk> <unk> and <unk> through this <unk> shock .
of course , this was an old , old <unk> <unk> , and i just thought to myself that the lesson has already been quite old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s when i was just working on elementary school , and i began to build my personal outside outside my family centers , and also forms into other people and the rest around the world around me .
and god thank god i didn &apos;t use a <unk> .
would i take that post seriously , i was born in a world that someone like me would perceive a person that lives in any sense would not be positive . now , i &apos;m going to be doing the opportunity and adventure that i experienced .
so i immediately woke up to the <unk> of 2009 , and i expected to find an <unk> contribution here .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this .
unfortunately , she &apos;s not much better .
in particular , my <unk> don &apos;t mind <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we think about these words .
it &apos;s about the values that put in these words and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greeks and the roman , have really believed that the pronunciation of a <unk> has a great force , because what they &apos;re talking about is <unk> .
so , what do we really want to do -- -- disabled people or a powerful man ?
just to say a human being <unk> as a child , it could be enough , and <unk> ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up doors ?
a human who was open to me door was my pediatrician at the <unk> dupont institute in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> , whose name , as they can think that most americans couldn &apos;t tell them correctly , so he was always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. dressed was very colorful , and they were just working with kids working with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great , to my <unk> .
i had to do any sense of infinitely a lot of times , with these big , elastic <unk> -- in different colors -- you know , to build my <unk> , and i hated these tapes . i hated her . i hated her .
and imagine , even though a child who had negotiate with dr. <unk> , and so they tried to stop these practices , fail without success .
and one day he taught me in one of my practice , they were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to tear one of those tapes .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
now , of course , this is a very simple trick of dr. p. so i do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the prospect of getting the richest , <unk> girls in the ward ward .
and i wonder today , as very powerful and powerful young girls , shaped my sense , and i could think of myself as an artist , of powerful , powerful and <unk> man .
this is just one example of many , such as adults , to encourage the imagination of a child .
but as you know , the <unk> examples of the <unk> evidence , our language doesn &apos;t have a space to imagine what we would wish to be , to give it to each individual , to see themselves as powerful .
our language changes the social changes behind it that were triggered by a technological change .
and from the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , for aging , allowing them to be able to use their natural capacity to move out of their own lives .
so this may be a sense of this technological change that no longer has been a different truth , which is that every person can society will be something quite a very strong and very powerful , and the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus us .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people constantly ask me to tell me how to do with me <unk> , and i &apos;m going to say to you something like that , &quot; i &apos;ve been feeling sorry about asking people , &quot; and i think , i understand why .
this is a set of exploration with <unk> , of the idea that success and happiness depends on solving the challenge , to be connected with the associated experience of a connected world , as i could overcome the possibility of a life with a prosthetic , or how people always perceive me with my disability .
but the truth is that we change . of course , we are challenged of the challenge whether it physically physically , emotional or even both .
and i want to argue that is good .
<unk> are not an obstacle that we need to move on to help our lives better .
<unk> are just our lives .
and i tend to think about seeing my shadow .
sometimes i realize it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s hardly to see , but it &apos;s all the time with me .
and i don &apos;t want to have any of the impact of the impact of a human impact .
there are <unk> , and the challenges , and these are just <unk> , and each person is about it differently , but the question is not whether we come out with uncertainty or not , but how we get it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people that we love to protect us from <unk> , but they prepare to prepare well to be very clear .
and we &apos;re not feeding our children if we give them feel that they can &apos;t adapt .
you need to separate two things : one of the medical fact , to be amputation , and to the other public opinion about whether i &apos;m disabled , or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability , with which i have to sit down , is that the world is always , they can tell me about these definitions .
in our desire to protect the people who are ours in the heart , giving them the real , hard truth about their medical forecast , or to actually give a prediction to the quality of life that she expects to do , that we &apos;re not supposed to be disabled .
maybe this is the current view , which is just looking at what &apos;s broken inside , and how we fix it , for every single more disability than the pathology rate itself .
if we don &apos;t treat a human society , we don &apos;t understand all of the forces and opportunities and recognizing that , in addition to the natural struggle that you might need to lead , another disease .
we <unk> a man who has a value to our society .
so we have to focus on the <unk> and focus on all the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of our flaws and our amazing <unk> .
we should not have these <unk> times or <unk> , we should not be trying to avoid them , we should go to the rug , but it &apos;s about finding the <unk> of opportunity .
i mean , i think , perhaps , is to realize that we don &apos;t necessarily need to overcome , but we &apos;re going to be open for them to embrace them in the <unk> , to give you a <unk> , and maybe even dancing with it .
and maybe we can see it <unk> as a natural , <unk> and useful , and we feel like not preoccupied with their presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 anniversary of charles darwin , when he wrote about evolution over 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , in a very true truth in human human beings .
i would call it this way not not to survive the most powerful of its species , and also , of course , is the ability to adapt to the best of its own .
from post-conflict forms of creativity emerges .
not just by darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people , survive and <unk> , from the struggle of the human mind , is determined to transform through conflict .
so again , again and change adaptation , the greatest capacity of human beings .
and maybe we know what we &apos;re out from the wood is where we &apos;re actually being <unk> .
perhaps that &apos;s the sense of <unk> , a sense of sensory , a sense of our own force .
we can give them ourselves ourselves .
we can give up a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see <unk> as a change .
<unk> are for change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we have received ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
let &apos;s face it , who &apos;s normal ?
there is no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the usual is not the normal . but would you really want to learn that poor person in the person if you really got them ?
i don &apos;t think more .
it would be great if we think this paradigm of normal towards the other direction or the strength , to actually even make a little bit more dangerous , so we can release the forces of very many , very important , and to bring them to respect their very special and meaningful skills in society .
<unk> found out that we &apos;ve always been asked by the members of our members of the society : one to be useful , to make a contribution .
there &apos;s hints that , neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , older people have been carrying with people with severe physical injuries , and this may be because the <unk> of <unk> people in society was valuable value .
they didn &apos;t look at these people as a broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i was in the city where i grew up , in a <unk> camp in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing here in a <unk> tomato .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear a guy behind me say , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee &apos;s . &quot;
and i &apos;m looking around , and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may not remember remember .
when i first saw her , she pulled her out of her stomach . &quot;
oh , so .
and of course , he &apos;d done it .
this was dr. <unk> , a man i only knew from my mother &apos;s day , because i was , of course , was unique , to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor of <unk> <unk> &apos;s mother was on holiday , and so my parents did the man who brought me to the world , not at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet were looking at them , and i had some toes like this , and i had some <unk> toes on the other , he was the <unk> , that strangers had to be the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be as physical or you could never live an independent life , and then they simply laughed at me . &quot;
i was really extraordinary , i found that when i collected all of my childhood , i didn &apos;t matter if i won the <unk> in the second class , whether i went to the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> medical school , and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> , the x factor , the potential of the human response .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how important that factor factor for the quality of life can be .
and dr. <unk> <unk> said that he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids when they don &apos;t say anything else , and even if they &apos;re just getting a little bit more , if they teach kids , they can make a lot of things . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
he had understood that medical anesthesia , and how people handle it , two different things are .
and again , i think , in the course of time , if you had asked me about 15 years old , if i had asked my prosthetic leg legs legs and bones bones , i would have never got a second .
i really wanted to act naturally at the time .
if you ask me now , i &apos;m not so sure .
and this is happening because i have experienced something with my legs and not through those experiences .
and perhaps that change was happening , because i &apos;ve been so many people who have opened me doors , instead of getting people who would take me or i wanted to have an idea .
see , it really takes one of people who can show them how they can express their forces , and they are through .
if you allow it to allow your ability to activate your forces , the forces -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for somebody in a critical moment , it &apos;s a very good teacher .
they bring them to open up doors .
the literal meaning of the <unk> , which is roots in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means to create something that is in terms of potential potential .
again , what chances are we going to do ?
in the late &apos; 60s , in case of the u.k. , we went into <unk> case in <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states . &quot;
the students are spread after grades .
and the a student are <unk> harder to get the better teachers .
and then they &apos;ve done a lot of time with students with a &quot; good &quot; <unk> &quot; -- &quot; they said , &quot; they were <unk> , they were very smart , and after these three months , they really wrote <unk> .
and of course , it &apos;s going to hear the heart that the <unk> said they said that they were just enough .
and then it was also after the three months .
but only those who still were in school -- except by the students who had gotten in school .
and crucially , in this study , the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were told to be that the <unk> is that the students are at least grade , and they also taught them something and treated them .
the only real disability is a mind that &apos;s broken , a mind that has been broken , has no hope anymore , and there &apos;s nothing more inherent from nature &apos;s missing , <unk> <unk> and our innate capacity of imagination .
if we can do it to support the human spirit , continue to hope , even further and other people around you are going to find beautiful and curious about what we &apos;re doing , really , really rewarding us .
if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and create new <unk> .
i want to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet called <unk> in the 14th century , and that my friend jacques cousteau tells me , &quot; the god knows god . &quot;
come on , thank you . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re at the moment ?
suppose i said , through very different changes of your genes , a better memory could have -- more accurate , more and more quickly .
or if you want to be more powerful , stronger power .
would you want to become more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be more alive for life ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who have come up to more creativity .
which would you like most ?
which would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would have creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see you .
a few . probably there &apos;s a lot to be so creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you decide for a good memory ?
some more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i love to be a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is it all a fantasy ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a <unk> theme here in the ted conference , but today i want to give you the point of a doctor &apos;s theme .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox orthodox wrote , once wrote a paper , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t sense any matter of biology . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the proof of biological evolution , this would be a very good point of trying to turn on your <unk> -- take them with your <unk> -- i give them the <unk> -- and i can &apos;t give them a look at the end of the speech .
but if you accept biological evolution , think about this , is it only about the past , or is it going to be the future ?
is it for other <unk> , or is it still us ?
this is another view of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the margins of the life , all the <unk> of the edges of the <unk> have evolved in evolutionary terms .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we divide by a small ancestor of modern chimpanzees , about six or eight million years .
in that period , there may be 20 or 25 different <unk> of hominids .
some have come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we are quite remote to share parts of the rest of the tree , but in part of the largest part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite equal .
is it clear that we can pull out of it , and the mechanism of a common bacteria can be able to produce the protein of the human brain that &apos;s used to treat the diabetic ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s from chemically <unk> from the pancreas .
and where we &apos;re talking about bacteria , are aware that every one of us in our gut is producing more bacteria than the cells on the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times so many .
i mean , think , when antonio damasio asks you to think about this , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give you all the nutrients that you could only want to offer without any effort in your own .
it &apos;s really easier for bacteria , with occasional interruptions of unintended consequences , <unk> , forced forced to hit the outcome .
but , you know , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they are in their lives .
they help nutrients in nutrients . and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a form of <unk> equilibrium in a form of species ?
or are we supposed to be something else -- something that maybe even adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back to the era of the big bang -- the earth , the solar system , about four and four billion years ago -- the first evidence of living organisms , perhaps as far as a <unk> or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , which has come together in the last <unk> years .
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , is the human life on a mere briefly ; the animal kingdom , like a single beat , and the human life , a small <unk> .
we were that .
this also includes the <unk> of this talk , so i hope you &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> d .
well , when i was a graduate student at college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by elegance and elegance about biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found , quite a fundamental thing : most of the existence of living in <unk> organisms , each cell is , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to move on to their <unk> .
but at the time , as <unk> organisms began to change things .
sexual reproduction is entering the picture .
and very important : in terms of sexual reproduction , which is the genome that &apos;s going to be the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the death of the body of death on the body are at the same moment as the sexual reproduction .
now i have to confess , if i was an <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , sex to sex -- it seemed pretty decent at the time , but with every year , it has come to my increasing doubt .
i &apos;ve come to see the emotions of george burns , who in las vegas shows his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a very poorly <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization as a physician , and i was thinking about the goal of being different than the goal of evolution -- not inevitably , just different .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
evolution is all over the genome of the genome to the next generation , <unk> and survival generation after generation .
now from a evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i think , like <unk> rockets , to develop the genetic <unk> into the next level of orbit , to go back into the sea .
i think we would all have the mood that woody allen would come to the expression , as he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to make immortality in my work .
i want to reach until i don &apos;t die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily necessarily prefer the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily be the biggest , the worst or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , the bacteria are there , and the <unk> steam , otherwise , if the fish were there , if they were there , they would have a vacuum that they had a <unk> environment to do it there .
so what does that mean when we look back in what happens in evolution , and how we think about the space of human beings , and most of us , in the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a number of options .
the first is we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reasons for that , if we had a number of medicine , we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes that would have otherwise been <unk> or from the population removed .
and second , we have as a species that gives us our environment so we &apos;ve managed to adapt it to us , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we hike around and we mix with so much that they can no longer say that isolation is necessary for evolution , to be <unk> .
one second option is that it will be a evolution of the traditional kind of , of course , imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here , that the wheels of evolution are slowly <unk> , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far as being isolated , when we colonize a planet planet , it will be <unk> and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way to see , a <unk> , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that &apos;s not just natural , but led and decided to us as a decision that we make .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s start to look at reality that people today , in some cultures make decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family is .
so , if you can &apos;t only think of the gender of your child , you can also vote about the gender of genetic change that could cure disease and prevent disease .
what if they could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or to eliminate it to reduce the risk of cancer or disease ?
would you not want to make these changes in your genes ?
when we <unk> , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the next year when we finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can use a sequence of three billion base of the human genome at a price of about $ 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it won &apos;t be much longer until the reality will be the 1,000 billion human genome , and it will become increasingly available for everyone .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering <unk> the <unk> prize for francis arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists , studying independently of various techniques developed by harnessing more complex techniques called &quot; <unk> arnold &quot; evolution .
a couple of years ago , the scientists had given <unk> <unk> <unk> for his research in presenting his adult <unk> , a <unk> , and by manipulation manipulation of only four genes , cell cell , to replicate it in a <unk> stem cell -- a cell potentially potentially that cell needs to be in your body .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that produced the human insulin in bacteria can produce viruses that are not just protecting themselves , but also to serve the other against other viruses .
believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in italy , a vaccine that has been transplanted into the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine a good thing that comes from tobacco ?
this is all true , and in the future , much more will be possible .
so suppose it &apos;s two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if they could make the sperm and <unk> or the <unk> of their egg , to give their children a better chance to live -- to eliminate the diabetes , eliminating the risk of treating the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want a healthier child ?
and then <unk> analytical , the same motor of science that can allow the changes to change disease , could also enable us to adopt <unk> , <unk> -- <unk> better .
why don &apos;t have the <unk> of <unk> ken <unk> , especially if you can extend it to the next generation of <unk> ?
why don &apos;t have the fast <unk> that are going to enable them to get faster and more ?
why no longer life ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re on a place where we can pass on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we become transformed by <unk> evolution .
we will have a process that demands may be 100,000 years , and we can compress it on a thousand years -- and maybe in the next 100 years .
these are decisions that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to be <unk> .
are we using these kinds of decisions that are better than the more successful is more friendly ?
or will we selectively eliminate different traits that we want for some of us , and not for others of us ?
are we going to be a society in <unk> and <unk> , or more robust and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
and at the deepest of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom we need to make in making these decisions ?
in the good ones in the evil , and once earlier , you might think these decisions are going to us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine , a special robot that gives you exquisite skills , or someone else who helps it go back and go back and go back .
we at <unk> berkeley calls these robots .
they &apos;re not anything else than something that they put in the morning and giving them extra strength and increase their pace further , and they will help to keep their balance .
this is indeed the real acceleration of human and machine .
but not only that -- so merging it together and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now , to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re going to start talking about the american soldiers , on average , about 100 pounds on his back , and there is the answer that you should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some of the major complications , <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we were going to think of this challenge , and create a design tool that would help us deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to you now -- or the human universal universal <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> i can wear 200 pounds above <unk> terrain , many hours long .
his flexible design enables it to make up deep , to crawl and to highly <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then increase my strength and perseverance .
we are to be able to imagine with this <unk> of this device , this new <unk> <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s take our view on the wheelchair with something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people around the world in the wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that is indeed a conservative estimate .
we often talk about a lot of people with spinal cord injury , who lived in the height of their lives -- 20s , &apos; 60s , and the wheelchair was the only one , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the population , the number of users .
and pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , or other things -- is a wheelchair .
and it &apos;s been around for the 500 years , since i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could begin to write a whole new chapter in mobility .
now let me introduce you to you , which will be carried by amanda <unk> , who had a <unk> over the age of 19 , which resulted that they couldn &apos;t walk around for 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda is wearing our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , signals that are <unk> on our <unk> , which is attached to her back .
there are also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hips , also as they &apos;re on their <unk> , which they move forward to this pretty <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old in <unk> , when an <unk> <unk> was a <unk> <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement below my <unk> .
not long after then , a doctor in my <unk> and he said , &quot; amanda , you can never go again . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he was <unk> every single hope of my consciousness .
more technologies have changed me since then , to learn , climb up , climb up and climb up with the hands .
but nothing was invented by letting me go back until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential to change life for future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for example , so for wheelchair users , but for everyone .
thank you .
in new york , i &apos;m a leader of the nonprofit organization called a <unk> called the hood .
if i don &apos;t get poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> in a volunteer volunteer on the volunteer .
now , in our cities , by volunteers , supported a <unk> <unk> , they have to be quite early on the <unk> to be able to be <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer volunteer , and i had a good opportunity to go in .
but it was still a race on the other volunteers to reach the <unk> to see what they were doing .
when i found the <unk> , he just had a very serious conversation with the permian epidemic that certainly had one of the worst days of their lives .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was standing in the <unk> and barefoot under a screen in the rain , while your house was burned .
the other volunteers coming up to me was -- let &apos;s call him <unk> martin -- reached the first time to go into the house and save the dog &apos;s ship rescue .
the dog ! i was <unk> .
there was some lawyer or a <unk> , who was now for the rest of his life to tell people that he was walking into a <unk> house to save a living organism , because it was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you &apos;ve got to go to the house .
you need to go up to the fire , and then you have to get a couple of shoes . &quot;
i swear to god .
now , not exactly what i &apos;d hope to do , but i went out -- walking down the stairs , to the &quot; the &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , which at this point you would be with pretty much finished , in the bedroom , to get a couple of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i would take my prey back down , where i was going to <unk> my <unk> and met my <unk> dog .
we put our values out to the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , much more attention than i was .
a couple of weeks later , the <unk> gave the letter letter to her <unk> for their loved operation for saving their house .
one of the <unk> estimates of kindness : somebody had brought them a pair of shoes .
and my profession at robin hood , as in my <unk> , as a volunteer volunteer , i witnessed the generosity of kindness in the great scale , but i also also believe the altruism and of the individual .
and do you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so , when i look at this room and see people who are either likely to achieve success , or on their way , i want to offer this conclusion : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait for you to make a difference in your life , until you reach your first million million .
if you have something to you , give it now .
put it in a <unk> , put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , we will offer an opportunity to save people &apos;s lives , but every day gives us the possibility of changing one .
so they go ; they save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of humankind &apos;s life .
a place where the women are going to lead to sex , say , &quot; hi , &quot; and the game is dedicated to day -- where fun is a serious matter .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their relationships .
this is the world of wild bonobos in congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our nearest living relative .
that means we have a common ancestry , an evolutionary grandmother , living about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos are showing us the other side of the coin .
as we have chimpanzees all of great , fear <unk> <unk> , led by the <unk> of <unk> female .
they &apos;ve come up with this , because this leads to a <unk> <unk> society , in the lethal violence , has not been observed .
but unfortunately , bonobos are most familiar with the primates .
they live in the deep waters of the <unk> , and the observation is just hard for it .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness -- -- the conflict of a violent struggle that has been adopted since almost since world war i.
it &apos;s not surprised that this destruction is the risk of bonobos .
<unk> and the decline of the bailout , that you can &apos;t fill a stadium with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a laugh at the fact that the trees are shattered .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have sex partners , also sex with sex partners , with <unk> and <unk> and conflict .
i don &apos;t say that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the bonobos are more than the <unk> of the bonobos .
bonobos -- as people -- they love to play their lives .
but it &apos;s not just <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s a fundamental essential to connection between connection and relationships .
and we learn to trust and the rules of the game .
so play is increasing creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of interactions , of diversity of ties .
and if you look at bonobos , they see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance , and rituals .
play is the <unk> of <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique images out of the wild .
first of a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about it .
so here we see a young female and males with a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin , &quot; she grabs it in the eggs . &quot;
i think it &apos;s more like it , it &apos;s not .
yeah !
so <unk> are common , both bonobo and humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the key thing you get into the game that -- and also , how the game needs to trust and trust -- while doing this is incredible fun .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take a lot of shapes that some are a little more quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover the other again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she &apos;s playing with a dinner .
i think , as you do , sometimes we play , and we <unk> our limitations of our interior and the worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that we &apos;re exploring and interacting with each other , and the unexpected currents that we form , are the real breeding ground of creativity .
this is just a small <unk> of insight , the bonobos to give us in our past and present .
but it &apos;s true that a secret to our future , a future where we have to adapt to increasing challenges , greater greater creativity and institutions to promote cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
so to succeed in the world , we need to play .
but are we going to make the best out of our <unk> ?
game is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people , they are not living with teeth and claws alone .
it &apos;s just when it &apos;s barely appropriate , it may be a <unk> .
and therefore , my <unk> , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution and play together , as we play the creativity and the awe of happiness .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in the center of 1979 , on the same same day , at the exact same moment , every baby season -- okay .
so two pairs , every one that is a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time to imagine the <unk> , because when you think of the whole time , you &apos;re not listening to you .
think of that for a moment .
and in this case , imagine that in a case , in this case , is that you have a corresponding <unk> that &apos;s based on the x chromosome out of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm carries a x chromosome on the chromosome .
both of them are <unk> , both of the fire .
we &apos;ll come back to these guys later .
in most of my activities , i put two hats .
under a hat , i &apos;m involved with the history of anatomy .
i &apos;m a study professor , and in this case , i study how people with basic anatomy -- the human body , animal bodies -- like <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , as they thought about bodies .
the other hat i &apos;ve been working with my work is the activist , as a <unk> -- or , as i say , sometimes as a <unk> lawyer -- of people , the patients of doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> <unk> to social social norms .
so for instance , i used to work with people who are twins twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than common .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people whose gender are <unk> -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male male or females .
and as general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a couple of examples of these types of <unk> that aren &apos;t the male or female .
in case you may have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of y y leaves the <unk> that we have all of <unk> , <unk> .
and that &apos;s why the testes drop out of testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to identify the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so a lot of testosterone , not a reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body develops according to the typical female female .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought up as a girl .
but it takes more often until they achieve puberty , and they grow up , and they develop , but they don &apos;t get their period until there is something that &apos;s going on .
and they do a couple of tests , and they figure out that instead of <unk> and the uterus , in fact , has <unk> , and she has a y chromosome .
but it &apos;s important to understand that you might take this person for men , but they don &apos;t really .
women , like men , in our bodies have something called <unk> .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> are <unk> , which are <unk> hormones .
most women , like i -- i believe a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual <unk> , but i think i probably have the typical rats -- most women like me actually talk to <unk> .
we produce <unk> , and we talk to <unk> .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually , a brain that has been exposed to the more than a woman who was born with testicles , and has a <unk> .
so the gender is really complicated ; <unk> are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , they can be spread across the bandwidth .
another example ago , a couple of years ago , i got the call from an old man man who was born when he was born , he had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , she had sex , and he had just found that he had <unk> and a uterus .
he had a extreme form of an <unk> .
he has <unk> chromosomes , and in the womb , his body was so highly active , they created a male male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> were <unk> , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male &apos;s face .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody knew anything .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was <unk> inside the fact that the doctors found out that it was female .
okay , just for a quick example of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , something called <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so , gender can be in many different varieties .
the reason why children do this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s <unk> or identical twins , it &apos;s <unk> -- by surgeons often be <unk> to the norm , because it &apos;s not a sense that was responsible for your physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they often do different kinds of surgical surgical surgeries because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that a specific <unk> characteristic associated with a specific identity .
so we have the concept that a woman has to be a female identity , to be a black person , is , supposedly , to have a african anatomy , in terms of its own story .
so we have this horrible <unk> idea .
and when we are faced with a body , which is actually something very different , it confused us about this .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> ideas .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is , when the children are born , are two people in a body .
where i &apos;ve seen most of the time i had experienced most of the time , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year , whose gender in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in berlin .
a lot of journalists call me the question , &quot; what are they going to do to tell us whether or <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
and i had to tell the journalist that they don &apos;t have this test .
now we know that sex is complicated enough that we need to admit that nature doesn &apos;t lead to the line between male and female , or between <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
so we have a situation where the further further our sophistication is that we need to recognize so much that these categories that we &apos;ve held for stable anatomic categories , which are very easy to create permanent <unk> , much more profitable than we thought .
and it &apos;s not only based on gender .
it &apos;s also in terms of the species that it turns out to be a lot more complicated than our primary capacity .
in terms of our science , we &apos;ve come into all sorts of <unk> areas .
we &apos;re going to propose to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees in our own .
what should we do with the fact that we can tell us from a few of them apart ?
as we keep continuing all our science forward , we come back into a zone of <unk> , where we need to recognize that the <unk> categories that we had probably been very simple .
we see that in all sorts of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the <unk> , in our culture , in today &apos;s united states , are the fights over the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what point a body to the human being , so that he has a right thing when fetal lives .
we have very difficult questions on these days -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never had so hard to fight when the dead was .
you know , someone would make a force under the nose , and when she moved , they didn &apos;t bury them .
if you don &apos;t move around , you &apos;ve buried them .
but today we are in a situation where we take people to take <unk> organs and take them to other people .
and as a result , we caught up with the struggle with the really challenging question when someone is dead , and it brings us to a really difficult situation where we have no more such <unk> categories like the earlier .
now , if you could think that all of you would collapse in categories like me really happy .
i &apos;m a political <unk> , i <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categories are much more likely to be when we thought that it worries me .
and it worries me in terms of the democracy .
so , to tell you about this <unk> , i have to first accept that i &apos;m a big fan of founding founding .
i know they were <unk> ; i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think they were so <unk> and strong , and radically radically , in what they did , to take the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s completely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened with the <unk> .
the founding fathers were out of my view of the cultural activists , which is why .
what she did was a <unk> concept , and they simply replaced it by another , which was radically and beautiful for 200 years .
as you all remember , our founding fathers came out of the monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simple concept of anatomy .
the <unk> of the ancient world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of copying .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power to have these political power , because of the <unk> of <unk> from the grandfather to the son to the son , and so on .
the founding fathers lined up with this idea , just replaced them with a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all of people have been being launched .
they <unk> the field of play , and they decided that <unk> the similarities , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they made this part because they were part of a <unk> system that had two things together .
democracy has grown up , but at the same time , grew up in science .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , it &apos;s clear that many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explaining explanations , and meadows things like a psychic concept of power , back , where the transmission was based on a very <unk> concept of <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , what we did was a concept that was common .
and they really prepared for the future civil future rights .
they didn &apos;t think of it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened years years ?
for example , women used the <unk> <unk> , the concept of the founding fathers , who says that the common thing is more important than the anatomical difference , and they said , &quot; that we have a uterus and <unk> , &quot; and that said &quot; is that we have no <unk> . &quot;
and women <unk> successfully .
next , the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who said , &quot; am i no woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> of the <unk> who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people of color color , which are related to anatomical relationships , again , successful .
we see the same thing about the <unk> .
of course , the problem is , as we start looking at all the similarities , we have to begin to ask ourselves why we sustain certain assets .
now , mind god , i would like to be certain <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in our culture .
i want to give you not for the same for a fish like a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say we should take off the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should be right to get sex consent to give sex .
so there are some anatomic <unk> that make sense of me , and that , i think , should be .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what they are and why we keep them and make it worthwhile .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both <unk> in the same same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months of birth were born , so she was born june june 1 .
<unk> , on the other hand , is born to the <unk> , so he was born in march 1 .
just because of the fact that maria was three months of born , born in all of the right , three months before <unk> , who has right to have sex sex , which is right to drink .
<unk> must be waiting for all this , because he actually has another biological age , just because of the <unk> of his birth .
we &apos;ll find other other <unk> about what their rights are .
<unk> , that assumes that he &apos;s male -- -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the <unk> -- that &apos;s where he &apos;s male , he can be moved in , which maria doesn &apos;t have to worry .
maria , in the states , can &apos;t see the same right , the <unk> in all states , who is right to marry .
<unk> can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states .
so we have these sustained categories categories in terms of problems and questionable .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our science is doing this progress on the anatomy , that we can get to a point where we have to admit that democracy is based on anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to give science science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels as if the science does its own .
so where are we going ?
it seems like our culture would take a kind of pragmatic reasoning : &quot; well , we need to move somewhere out , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas at the point is that , to marry a man , means that you have no y chromosome , and marry a woman that you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested in their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also weird , because of the history that i told you about the beginning of the <unk> .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of the modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us a &quot; dream &quot; is a kind of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t want to go to &quot; her skin , &quot; but based on the quality of your character , &quot; and goes beyond the anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how are people looking at people on their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re going to have rights to people on the people , because i have to admit that i have a series of golden <unk> that are likely to make more than some people i know .
i want to suggest that i probably have a bright <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , more <unk> and more choices on their sexual relationships as some of these sexual relationships that i know .
so how are we going to ask the question for the characteristics of character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me tell you what if the contents of a personality was something that would be in the future -- could be detected in the future ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that really seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is really going to be concerned about questions about democracy .
in our quest to democracy , we &apos;ve done our good job , and i think we &apos;d do good in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , as it is , in the case of iran , where a man who feels attracted to other men who is punished by being punished , he &apos;s ready to perform a <unk> in which he can stay alive .
now we don &apos;t exist in the situation .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i talked about a few years ago who had had some <unk> twins separated by dividing them to become a name .
but when i came up with him , and he asked him why he was doing these surgeries , they were highly effective surgeries -- was his answer that in his country , those kids were going to be treated badly , and so he had to do it .
i said to him , &quot; well , they hypothesized that they were going to consider political intervention instead of being a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible opportunities to allow people to allow those who they are , without having to change the state of the state .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be connected .
well , just to finish , i want to notice that i talked about a lot about the dads .
and i want to think about the possibility of thinking like democracy , or looked like if we had more involved in mothers .
and i want to say something that is a radical feminist , and i think that there may be different types of insights that are made by different kinds of anatomy , <unk> people when people use a <unk> .
for years , since i was interested in <unk> , i was also interested in research in the field of research .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from early studies is that women , on average -- not every , but on average , we tend to tend to have complex social relationships and caring for people who are vulnerable to the group .
and so , if we think about this , we have an interesting situation to ourselves .
years ago , when i was a graduate school , i asked one of my favorite people who had my interest in feminism -- i was as a feminist , i &apos;m going to do it -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s female female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about making stereotypes about gender , so she &apos;s not female female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i was thinking that there might be some <unk> of feminism in feminism .
that should say , there might be something , on average , and the female brains of gender are different from what makes us social responsibility for <unk> social issues , to make care for the <unk> .
so where the founding fathers were extremely carefully about finding how individuals could be protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more <unk> into this concept , we &apos;re more <unk> to think about , but how we protect them .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go to the future , when we put democracy through basic anatomy -- less than the individual bodies to think about identity , and think about relationships .
so , when we &apos;re trying to make a human connection , we &apos;re thinking about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in this , i &apos;m going to do a very bad confession , which is : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to meet a different way of outfit and <unk> outfit and wear and <unk> and <unk> .
but i don &apos;t buy a new thing .
i get all my clothes out of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> to the environment , and it &apos;s on my wallet .
i &apos;m going to meet all sorts of great people ; it &apos;s serving for a good purpose , and i look quite quite unique ; and it makes power shop for my personal personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
will i like the color ?
does it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers say yes , i feel like if i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i tell you what i wrote for this exciting week for ted .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly exactly what i brought with .
i brought a pair of <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for a week , everything i did in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve bet anybody else i wanted to wear anything else , what if i came up to palm springs .
and since you haven &apos;t heard about me , as the woman , walking around at ted in your underwear -- that &apos;s what i found a couple of things .
and i &apos;d like to show you my <unk> for this week .
does it sound ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to leave you with some of the lessons that i believe if you believe it or not , from those <unk> , have to have anything new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i &apos;ll call that the shining tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can always be beautiful for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the paper served me over 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried on this week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological <unk> impossible to be bad if you wear pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you make other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation becomes completely <unk> .
i spent a lot of time in my life to try to be myself , and adapt to simultaneously .
just be who you are .
when they surround them in the right people , they will not only understand it , they &apos;ll also appreciate it .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i looked like if they dress in love , and i remember her <unk> .
i want to smile , and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think that you &apos;re not looking good at something , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me a day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what it means .
and i &apos;ll just summarize that for you .
if you believe that you are inside the front of a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can carry in .
so there &apos;s no excuse me for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to fix everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> adapt to everything .
and finally , saturday , you own unique , personal imagination , is a great way to tell the world something about something without saying a word .
it always occurred to me and once again , when people came up to me , just just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it won &apos;t fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go to brooklyn , i will bring it all up again .
because the lesson i &apos;ve been trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to do these things emotionally , because in order around the corner , there &apos;s always crazy crazy , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is just waiting for me when i love a little bit in the heart and find it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as a <unk> as flying flying .
this is what we call our <unk> , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is something interesting in the last decade decades .
so , sometime ago , if you wanted to win a formula one game , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , if you &apos;re going to take a race , actually , if you want to win a race , actually something that &apos;s going to be used in real time , a few sensors , the information that &apos;s going on on , and then use this information to send that information back and real-time things back in real time .
this would be , in <unk> , called <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made from two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is that the <unk> process is beginning to appear in our lives .
our cities have been delivered , in the last few years , just equipped with networks and electronics .
they become free in computers .
and as a computer in the free , they start to react to other places , they are perceived and driven .
when we go to cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- caused by 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , it &apos;s going to take all of that sense and drive in objects in everyday lives .
this is from an exhibition that was paola antonelli at moma later in the year during the summer , in the summer .
&quot; it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
now , all our objects , our environment , begin to speak back to us .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as if each atom is out out of either , a sensor and a <unk> .
and that changes radically radically the interaction we have people with our environment .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as michelangelo formed the moses , it says that at the end of the hammer , and he took him on moses -- and in fact , you could still see a little spot spot -- and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why are you not talking ? &quot;
now , today , our environment starts to respond to the first time to answer .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of the environment and to drive it .
let &apos;s start with that .
now the first project i &apos;d like to introduce you to is actually one of the first of our lab .
it was in four and a half years ago .
and what we did , in fact , was actually used a new kind of network that used to be used throughout the world -- this is a <unk> -- and <unk> blind information from this network , which are <unk> from being used by the site .
the summer was a happy day -- 2006 .
it was the <unk> won .
some of you will remember , it was played against france , and then at the end of the <unk> , the <unk> .
and anyway , italy .
now you see what happened on that day , just when we observe the activity that happened in the network .
this is the city .
you see in the middle , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline .
early afternoon , people here , and here , calls the phone and move .
the game starts to be silent .
france is a gateway to italy . italy is a gateway .
<unk> , people make a quick call , go to toilet .
second second . it &apos;s the end of the regular .
first long , second .
<unk> , in a moment of dreaming .
italy , yeah .
well , this night , everybody went to the center .
they saw the great cause .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister of the same time .
and then all went down .
you see the image of the space center , where , since the roman century , the people who go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the cause of the day .
well , this is just one example of how we can see the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do a few years ago .
even more quickly , for example , this is not about people , but about things that we use and consume things .
now , we know all of our things about where our things are .
this is a map that gives you all the chips that a mac computer involves how they came together .
but we just know little about where the things go .
so we actually actually designed some little markers to actually track the waste as it comes through the system .
so we started with a few volunteers who said , a little more than a year ago , in seattle , they have helped to highlight the things that they see -- they &apos;re different types of things , as you can see -- things that they would throw away .
then we have the little chips , little little brands , glued to garbage , to track it .
here are the results we &apos;ve got right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with that information we realized that there is a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same thing about less energy .
the data was not available .
but that &apos;s going to happen a lot of <unk> and complex things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , that the cup that we throw away , not simply disappear , that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that keeps <unk> every day .
and if we show those people , then we can drive change behavior .
so this is the reason for this project .
so my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could also tell you a lot more about it , and the many other wonderful things that you can do with you , and i &apos;d like to talk to the second part , which is the most compelling of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years in <unk> , spain .
it started with a matter of <unk> that came to us , and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition of using public areas as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could we introduce technology to new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were <unk> at <unk> , they put these tubes , and valves , <unk> , valves that open up and closing .
they create something like a <unk> <unk> water .
when those mountains fall down , they can write on them , they can see patterns , images , text ads .
and they can approach it , and he will open up to open them up , to see them in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of <unk> .
it really enjoyed him .
and we got the assignment to design a building in the expo expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was from water .
there are no doors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up and put it in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you want to do that , you can actually lower the roof .
or you could close the building , and all of the architecture is , like in this case , you know , those days when you get the roof up , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; they &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t rebuild the building , it &apos;s just that the architecture is almost away .
this is how the building works .
you see the person who says what &apos;s going on inside .
and here you see me , when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , opened the water .
well , i should tell you what happened in the night when the sensors stopped working all the time .
but in fact , it was a little more fun .
all the kids from <unk> came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was completely different .
no longer a building that open up to open them , but a building that still has time and some water in the water , you have to have to dive into no wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about it like the people who use things that we &apos;re designing .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and this is the beautiful thing about creating things that are used and interact with the people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projections .
and this is what led us to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
so , imagine you could start to fly into these meetings really .
imagine you could have little helicopters flying flying through the air , and every one of them with a little <unk> with light light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter that you saw before , who &apos;s moving over with each other , moving in synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of a screen or a display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or irregular , in contrast , in terms of changing what &apos;s going on , the light is not the position of <unk> .
they can play with different types .
imagine the screen screen appear to appear in different ways or sizes , in different colors .
but then all of this could be a very cloud cloud of <unk> where they can walk up and move through that they can move from many , many directions .
here you see a real <unk> show , <unk> , like <unk> <unk> .
when you turn the light , it looks like this . so , as we saw it before .
imagine that every single person is controlled .
it could have every single element of the impulse that comes from people who are coming from people &apos;s motions or so forth .
i want to show you something first of all .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> in milan -- and we put his movements in 3d to use them as an impulse for <unk> .
here are dancing dancing .
on the left , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so you can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then once we have all <unk> , they can play with play and play motion and play motion .
that &apos;s what we want to be as a potential impulse to use .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on in the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , again , imagine what we &apos;re going to do to engage with people to do something and to change the environment -- almost something like how we call it <unk> , but how to move a cloud .
imagine that each one can give a small donation for a <unk> donation .
i think that the astonishing of the events that happened in the last few years , the last few years is that we &apos;ve changed from a digital world .
this is all digitized , knowledge , and it &apos;s accessible to the internet .
now , for the first time , for the first time -- and the campaign of obama has shown this -- we can see from the digital world from the <unk> forces of the network to the physical world .
this can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can come to challenge our challenges -- think about climate change or the co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to the physical .
so the idea is that we actually actually bring people into what they are doing together , collectively .
the cloud is back a cloud from <unk> , in the same way a really cloud cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud cloud is a cloud .
it &apos;s an amazing thing in london , but covered with <unk> .
they can move in and move different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them from the bottom , the most important moments of <unk> and 2012 , and it &apos;s also as a kind of connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky , and something at the top you can go , like london &apos;s new zealand .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital technology in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience of all , that wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the problem is really important .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separate from nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was at the last 10 years ago , where i saw my first <unk> .
i was <unk> .
my heart sped up , i was <unk> when i was trying to capture what was going to me .
the <unk> around me , almost 13 meters from the water , and i could just wonder , that was a snowflake on a different snowflake , year after year .
<unk> , are born as a calf and drought , by breaking out of <unk> .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact in a clear way of their surroundings and their experiences .
some refuse to give up and <unk> into the bitter end , while others can &apos;t be able to withstand it and get into <unk> seizure of depression .
if you look at a iceberg , you think it &apos;s isolated , apart , apart , just as we see people often often .
but the truth is far from it .
while there was a iceberg , floating around the surface of the ice .
during the iceberg , it puts a <unk> fresh water that feeds a lot of life .
i &apos;m going to go to my <unk> of this <unk> , as i would make portraits of my ancestor , in consciousness , that they live in these individual moments , never , even again .
it &apos;s not a death when they melt ; it &apos;s not the end , but it &apos;s a <unk> of your life cycle .
part of the ice in the ice that i &apos;m initiating is very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i have in <unk> in greenland in greenland .
very rarely , you can actually witness a <unk> of a sudden .
so here &apos;s what you see .
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg , and where it is at the <unk> .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved on the other side , the man &apos;s standing there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is real time .
and just like this , showing the iceberg a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is truly extraordinary by doing some of these amazing projects .
but at the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the &apos; 80s .
then one day , he came from walking back and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak outbreak .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood him to him .
i have a company to design design and animations , so this is inevitably a complex part of what we admire and art in the art world .
so we decided to see tony -- <unk> -- and to help his job .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony again .
and i just wanted to talk to him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t get rid of all of the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard a higher insurance , you have a remarkable insurance , you can really do it .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how are you communicating this ? &quot;
anybody saw the film &quot; butterfly &quot; and &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
that &apos;s how you communicate -- so you walk your finger down .
i <unk> : &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need to just take a check , and instead i put a check , i didn &apos;t know the slightest idea of how i was going to know it .
i committed to place and place to his brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this : &quot; will be going to give him a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to make him a way that he can make his art again . &quot;
because it &apos;s a farce that somebody who is still in it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so , i was talking to a couple of months later .
i met these people from <unk> , the research research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project light on any surface , and then draw with a drawing of it that they only found the negative area .
so they pull around and do things like this .
they say that all of the things that are put up there on a whole life cycle .
it starts with the <unk> , then the <unk> , then the <unk> , and finally , people really do art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentation .
so i went home and ate my wife , and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second , if there &apos;s this technology , you know , if you can use your eyes to do things that we can make it away . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first , we put the insurance stations , and we actually have the device to get a device that can communicate with -- a stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
furthermore , we have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to home .
my wife , my kids , and i moved to the garage , and these <unk> and programmers and <unk> and <unk> our house .
a lot of our friends thought that we were pretty dumb to do this , and that we <unk> and all the images on the walls would be <unk> <unk> .
but for about two weeks , we &apos;ve been programmed , we went to <unk> <unk> in venice , my children were involved in my own dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought on the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things out of the hardware store and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they put them in <unk> , and they have a device for free , and now we have a device that is free -- it can build it , we provide the code for free , the software can free for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device which is completely free of limitations .
no insurance can <unk> .
not a hospital .
and the paralyzed paralyzed can actually communicate with their eyes , or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much . that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back into <unk> room .
i love this image , because it &apos;s the room from somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s all of these <unk> before the great revelation .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> his first time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he sees a life support system .
we &apos;ve tilted his bed so he can contemplate .
we put a projection for a <unk> of the hospital hospital .
and he drew back to the first time , in his family &apos;s friends and friends -- and you can imagine , which was a little sense that was a lot of feeling .
but in addition to <unk> we had to get into the parking lot , and we felt so much as a part of the <unk> .
so at the end , he would give us an e-mail with this content : &quot; for the first time for seven years , i had drawn this .
i feel that i was left under water , and finally got a <unk> up and lifted up my head so that i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
that &apos;s something like our <unk> .
it keeps us around , and we continue to evolve .
and we need to improve a lot on this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes up with a <unk> .
and somebody who has such such potential potential , deserves a lot more .
so we &apos;re finding out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all the evidence .
we won the number of awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve .
it &apos;s all out of our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> about us , and then on december , we celebrated the ted prize when one of the best achievements inventions were in 2010 , which was really neat .
the theme part of this is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that this april , the <unk> <unk> studio in downtown los angeles show an exhibition called &quot; kind of the <unk> . &quot;
and there will be pretty much the toughest agents of <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is pretty <unk> .
so basically , i &apos;m thinking , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then it &apos;ll be possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , the microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- all of this .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never been trying to do something with <unk> , but i just just got something caught and incredible me around with these guys , so that we could put something on the legs .
and this question should be , every single one of you , and every single day you want something to do something that needs to be done , if not ? when if i haven &apos;t ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most <unk> <unk> .
and i always tell people that i &apos;m not going to want to come as a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever chosen a farmer .
today i want to tell you about circles and <unk> .
well , there is a peace enlightenment usually , because you can find it somewhere .
you go around the block and it was a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you about today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s , high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was going to be <unk> every week in the <unk> and blue , until a teacher she saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me use the toilet in the <unk> .
did she secretly .
it did three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it proposed me to san francisco to california -- i found a lover -- and in the &apos; 80s , i found it to be able to record a work at <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i received a phone call from this teacher , woman , who said , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come back with me with the man i know you &apos;ve found it now .
and i should mention that i have <unk> , and i want you to go out there . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew she had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them up , and we care about them , and we gave them their family eight because they needed to be .
it was something we knew about .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as a adults , they wanted to know me , she turned out to a <unk> , and was put in my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of which i was talking about .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life takes everything that takes the rest of life .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so often here today .
it takes the same -- it needs to love , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big blast when you climb up to a thousand feet .
imagine a plane filled with smoke .
imagine a engine , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this sounds fear .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at them , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve caught a couple of birds . &quot;
the pilot had already been <unk> and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things later did .
the pilot scan the machine to the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not <unk> .
he powering the engines .
imagine a <unk> aircraft .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard of .
he says , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk about <unk> .
i could see it in her eyes , there was horror , life was at the end .
i want to share with you three things that i learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have these <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach out , and they didn &apos;t do all the other things that i wanted to do , and i never did .
while i thought about it , i said , &quot; i &apos;m not saying wines . &quot;
because when the wine is out there , and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to shift things in life .
and this urgency , this goal , changed my life really changed .
the second thing that i learned that day -- and that was when we moved to george george bridge , so i was thinking about it -- i thought , &quot; oh , there &apos;s one thing i really had .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , with my failures , i <unk> , to get better , everything i &apos;m doing .
but in my own , i &apos;ve given my ego of ego .
and i &apos;m going to spend the time that wasted waste of <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i was thinking about the relationship with my wife , to my friends , to people .
and then , when i was thinking about it , i decided i could ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have two years old with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have right , i have to decide to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- and while in the <unk> clock , 15 , 14 , 13 .
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please get into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to break this thing into 20 parts of what you know from a documentary .
as we <unk> , i had this feeling , man , dying is not scary .
almost like , we would prepare for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness really really felt in a thought , which is that i just had one thing .
i just wish i could grow my kids grow up .
about a month after that , i went to a show of my daughter -- <unk> , not a lot of <unk> talent ...
... not yet .
and i <unk> , i cry like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made a sense of me .
i realized , by the time , i got to address the edges , that it &apos;s just about a great father .
more than anything , anything else , my only goal is to be a good father .
i was given the miracle of dying in this day .
i received one another gift , which is going to see in the future and come back and live .
my call all of you who fly today is : imagine : the same thing happens on your flight -- you don &apos;t -- but do you think about it , and how would you change ?
what would you do when you delay , because you think you &apos;d be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are the best parents that they can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> wheel is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want the building to build the bomb .
the most important entry there is for the developing world nuclear weapons in <unk> .
the gray ones you see here , these are <unk> .
now if we manage to control the systems that are controlling the control of valves and valves , then we can actually get a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these <unk> <unk> are not running with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we make it that an effective system on a laptop on <unk> , which is used by a <unk> <unk> to get this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> will get into the gray box , breaking the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> increases .
that &apos;s a <unk> , right ?
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve found that .
when we started investigating our research six years ago , it was completely unknown , which was a sense of purpose and purpose to this .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is part of the <unk> part , the <unk> part , he made up by <unk> <unk> of their <unk> .
and it seemed to be a little bit of <unk> with these <unk> boxes , these <unk> <unk> .
we <unk> our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we infected our environment with infected people , and we studied this .
and then something funny .
<unk> <unk> , like a <unk> that doesn &apos;t liked our cheese -- <unk> , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we &apos;ve been experimenting with various kinds of cheese , i went to see that this is an attack attack .
completely backward .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the gray box to a place when there was discovered special configuration , even if this particular program that it &apos;s trying to infect it on .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t even do anything .
so , the really really wanted my interest , and we started working on it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a <unk> american power station , or a <unk> <unk> company in germany .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> we found the <unk> code , and we found out at two digital warheads are <unk> -- a smaller and a larger one .
and we also noticed that they were very <unk> designed , people who had all given <unk> information .
they knew all sorts of bits and <unk> that had to attack .
you probably knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already heard that the <unk> of <unk> complex and <unk> is , let me tell you that the <unk> are a science for us .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
this is a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about here -- approximately 15,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were smart in this code .
so , what we were looking for was first , we were <unk> , because we know what this cause .
and then we searched for <unk> and <unk> and tried to bring these with the real world into connection -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could justify or <unk> .
so to bring these theories , we call ourselves that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to be a <unk> goal , and very likely it is in iran because most infections were reported .
well , in this area , there &apos;s not many thousands of targets .
basically , it &apos;s <unk> on the <unk> nuclear power plant , and on <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; i &apos;m going to bring a list of all the experts on the <unk> and the power plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them up and <unk> her knowledge to compare their expertise , what we found in the code and in the data .
and it worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the digital digital gateway to the <unk> .
the <unk> is this moving part of the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you <unk> the speed of this brain , you can actually <unk> the rotor , and eventually it &apos;s actually able to crack the centrifuge .
what we also found is that the goal of the attack was actually going to make it and slowly and <unk> scary , so that they couldn &apos;t be able to get back to this very quickly .
the great digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse of how we looked at exactly the data and we looked at it .
so for example , the number <unk> is <unk> out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i began to <unk> scientific literature about how these <unk> <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they &apos;re <unk> in what &apos;s called <unk> , and every <unk> contains <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , fit it together .
and it became better .
these <unk> in iran is distributed in 15 cities .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
almost identical structure .
so again , that really fit together .
and this gave us great confidence for what we looked at here .
well , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t just go .
these results were getting through a few weeks of hard work .
and often we just started to get a <unk> , and we had to collect new .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads are actually grounded in reality , and the same goal , but from different directions .
the small <unk> takes over a <unk> , and <unk> the rotors and accelerating it and the big <unk> bursts to interact with six <unk> and interacting with them .
so , in large , all of us , we &apos;re very hopeful that we actually have , what &apos;s the goal .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals should be hit by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- made me totally out of socks .
down there is the gray box , and on top of you see the <unk> .
now what this thing is doing is that the charges of sensors , <unk> -- so for example , from <unk> and <unk> -- and it provides <unk> code for the attack that &apos;s going on with the false servers .
and in fact , this false compiled data was recorded before .
so it &apos;s exactly like <unk> , where the <unk> is fed by <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
now , the idea of this is obviously not just <unk> the control room in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is <unk> <unk> .
we need a <unk> <unk> site where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond to fast enough .
so for example , in the power station , when the big <unk> will be too fast , you need to open up hours of milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human <unk> .
so at this point , we need a digital <unk> .
and if they &apos;re at risk , there are really bad things going to happen .
the power station can explode .
and neither the <unk> , nor is the <unk> .
this is frightening .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he doesn &apos;t have anything to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , for example , it would be exactly like well -- in a power plant , or in a power station .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker , you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> stick as we &apos;ve seen it .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you eventually get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to confront .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the most vulnerable environments .
we have to face the consequences , and we start to prepare better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s been very much covered in the fact that people think the <unk> is the <unk> .
is it your mind ?
okay , so you really want to know ?
yeah . okay .
in my opinion , the <unk> is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , for happiness .
because otherwise , our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for a <unk> . thank you .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years to put myself in situations where these are very difficult , and somehow dangerous .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i worked in a <unk> war -- dangerous .
i filmed filmed -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing like this -- to start a little bit hard in the middle , very dangerous .
in fact , i &apos;ve seen the most part of my career that appears to be faced with <unk> situations , which is just trying to study social issues so that they &apos;re compelling , interesting , and hopefully in a way of understanding what makes it fun for the audiences .
so when i knew i &apos;d come here to talk about a tedtalk in the tedtalk of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would do something a little bit else .
some of you may have heard of that , a few weeks ago , i ran a ad on ebay .
so i sent a couple of <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to bring to the tedtalk to my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , got the opportunity to do -- because i &apos;m sure that anderson anderson will never let me buy , say , &quot; the <unk> of the talk , and didn &apos;t have a lot of evidence on what the subject would be .
so what you got was , you know , your name here : my tedtalk that you have no idea of what the subject is going to be , and the one in which you could fly your own <unk> , especially if i want to make your <unk> stupid things .
but again , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people watch this tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so , at that warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
so if you had asked me this before a year , i wouldn &apos;t have to be able to tell you this to know .
but in the new project i &apos;m working on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been doing a lot of terrible situations in the course of years , but nothing could prepare for me to do anything that was so difficult and so dangerous like this guy in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and commercials , where the whole film is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the movie will become &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; is that everything , from top to bottom , from the beginning to end , totally <unk> by -- the <unk> that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is the brand brand of <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center .
these people will be connected to life in infinity -- forever .
and so the movie is going to explore this whole idea -- this is what it is in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to the accent .
it was &quot; in eternity . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have the brand of x than <unk> , but we &apos;re going to make sure we can sell any possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe , and he will be the greatest shoe they ever wore .
the greatest car that you ever have , the &quot; <unk> of <unk> <unk> , &quot; the greatest drink that you have ever had , &quot; a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is to show that that brands are a part of life , actually , to get them to fund the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the film .
so this is the whole idea , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i &apos;d be happy if <unk> help it do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; vision , &quot; because that has a negative impact -- but you know what &apos;s going to be developing ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s definitely worth putting a big brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we might look like a <unk> <unk> .
what do you believe what the answer is ?
the answer is probably probably &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing about the film or a difficult thing about me ?
jk : both .
so , it &apos;s not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people that they have to do with ...
there are some places we can turn on .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera would mean &quot; that means we wanted to make a <unk> .
it turns out it was really , &quot; we want to do with a film . &quot;
and just so all of those disappeared , one of them .
no one wanted to do with the film .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do with the project .
and i was confused because i thought the whole concept was the idea of advertising , to show your product as many people as possible for it as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , with this interface of new and old media media and the media landscape -- is it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new heady <unk> that the masses will make this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had an error mistake , and that was this .
in fact , no , it wasn &apos;t the mistake .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would be okay .
but what that represents is a problem .
see , if you put transparency in the <unk> , that -- this is one of the first images that appears out .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- <unk> of deception and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> <unk> . immediately .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a whole lot of transparency now .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes out , it should be implemented , changes anything .
but why ? well , transparency is fear <unk> -- like this strange bear that still remains .
she &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and they &apos;re also very risky .
what else might be risky ?
a <unk> bowl of cool food .
that &apos;s a very risky thing .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my dad got me on me -- and he sits down and looks at me looking at this -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three versions . &quot;
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there are the real version . &quot;
so you see , this film that we wanted to tell the story .
but there was just a company , an agency , to help us -- and that only because , when i knew john bond , and richard <unk> , for the age of years -- i found that i had to do it , and i had to go out and do this with my team to the company .
so what they suddenly began to understand -- or what i started to understand was that , when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem .
i have friends who make big , gigantic <unk> , and i have friends who make little <unk> like i do .
and my friends , the great , gigantic <unk> , say that the reason why their movies are so successful , they have their <unk> , they have .
and then my friends say , the little <unk> , &quot; well , how are we competing with these great , <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , how are we going to see that in the film ?
whenever i do it , i &apos;m going to do it , and whenever i open the <unk> , they &apos;re going to see ban <unk> .
and every time i <unk> somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
so , look it ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
maybe you should have a little bit of the interview before this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either so-called &quot; <unk> fusion or &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be both for men and women -- they &apos;re <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now , i can answer all your questions and give you a <unk> .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about these little movies , we &apos;re as a brand brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget of other brands .
so , these things -- you know , people remember this ban -- this is kind of why we &apos;re interested .
what would you describe the word ?
ban is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way to describe something like something that &apos;s going on .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; honey &quot; is a great word that this category is really to be a positive positive versus contrary to &quot; the smell and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how do we keep them fresh , better fresh , more fresh , more fresh .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man on the street who are like me , <unk> .
you want to tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like a beautiful dress .
&quot; <unk> <unk> meets at <unk> , except at <unk> .
okay , what &apos;s the brand brand ?
unique .
i think the <unk> style , i think , is the &quot; glamour glamour . &quot;
i like many black colors , lots of <unk> , and stuff like that .
but normally i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic <unk> <unk> .
and two of the brand that i am is , i would say , <unk> fly .
woman 2 : partly hippie , partly <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man three : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> in the whole country around the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
attorney : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom &apos;s .
now , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i &apos;m often looking at the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what happened was that i needed a specialist .
i needed somebody who could put me in my head , somebody who could really help me understand what was called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to help find these <unk> .
if they could do it for those , they could help me .
they brought their pictures , right ?
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about it .
these are the people who reflect my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : the world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way that life lives , and work .
all these things come from , and start from a place , and for me , and i start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is about the thoughts and feelings about themselves ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are queer . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; why do you get us ?
what is the <unk> ? where <unk> are you right now ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what is the red ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
a little more about them they don &apos;t .
what else did they go through ?
... doesn &apos;t have to be a fear . what kind of rollercoaster is you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yeah . well , well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
and there was a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing that i saw was this idea that their <unk> were two , but <unk> pages -- that morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
add up very well .
and i think there is almost a contradiction .
and i think some companies will just focus on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things where they &apos;re not safe , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , and these <unk> , and they turn them into something positive , and that is a <unk> <unk> .
what other brands are doing ?
the first one is a classic apple .
and you can also see it , <unk> , wii by mini mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there &apos;s <unk> brands and brands brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , brand brand is a very strong thing .
a <unk> , brand brand . how is your brand ?
if anyone asked you to describe your <unk> , your <unk> , how would you ?
she &apos;s a <unk> ? do you make your blood <unk> out there ?
or are they more likely to be ?
are you something that &apos;s a little more quiet , <unk> , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh like <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , magical , <unk> and magically .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , safe , safe , safe , <unk> , <unk> and wise like the dalai lama or the <unk> ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies , got up and <unk> and the &quot; no &quot; said , because they wanted to be part of the project .
they wanted to do anything about this film because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but then , 17 percent of the people who were willing to get on the control that they want to do with people , and they were playful , and how they wanted to tell us , we tell , telling stories , that we would not have to tell stories that stories would not never support .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film that you use <unk> <unk> , to use the <unk> of the brain , both in advertising to make it as well as films .
we went to sao paulo , where the <unk> would have been banned .
in the entire city , for five years , no poster , no posters , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went to school schools where companies have their way into <unk> schools , in america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i interacted with things .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and said that the agencies might not have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artists right .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that makes people think that we think our world .
and how did it be ? what was successful ?
now , the film that film film festival has happened , we can see this time .
according to the <unk> , the debut of january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> of this film .
it &apos;s actually just a period of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been left yet .
it doesn &apos;t even exist online . no <unk> .
he hasn &apos;t come out of other countries .
well , finally , this film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , at least as any <unk> that we talked to people about their customers .
something that i believe is that if you take your chance to take your chance to risk that risks are in these risks .
i think if you prevent people from it , you get them closer .
i believe that if you train your employees to avoid the risks , you &apos;re prepared for you to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear that they might be <unk> .
finally , in the future , we should be welcome to the fear .
we should be the bear in the cage .
they welcome the fear . they welcome the risk .
each one is a great <unk> full , so we &apos;re going to embrace the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
now more than ever , it gives us a little bit of honesty .
and this is done with honesty and transparency , my entire talk talk , &quot; they were welcomed with me from my good friends from <unk> that donated <unk> dollars for ebay .
big data will be created for organizations around the world .
<unk> : &quot; please invite transparency &quot;
thank you .
now morgan morgan : so on the name of transparency this : what &apos;s happened with the $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i put a check in my pocket , put on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago i did something else to google , and i &apos;m going to do something about museums and art , my <unk> <unk> , who is today , gave me the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with the most interesting interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demonstration .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal perspective is very simple with this slide and your access .
i grew up in india .
i was given a great education -- i didn &apos;t -- i didn &apos;t -- but i had too many museums and all of my artwork .
when i went to visit these museums , i began to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i was trying to work this -- making art more accessible to technology .
and then we trained a team , a team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demo , and i &apos;m going to tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you just go to <unk>
you can look around in these museums .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the van <unk> , van van .
i even come to one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get it in two ways -- it &apos;s very simple .
<unk> and <unk> , you &apos;re in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you walk around and it &apos;s funny .
they want to orient in the museum ?
open up the map , and jump ahead with a click .
in them , they want to be <unk> to the gang .
just more . lots of fun .
look out .
thank you , but the best one is coming .
now i am from one of my <unk> , <unk> from <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
when the museum has given us the picture , click on it .
so this is one of the images .
these are all metadata .
those of you who really are interested in art , you can click here , but i click it now .
this is one of the images we followed with the so-called <unk> .
this image , for example , has 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get to 10 billion <unk> ? &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can get very easily and <unk> .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
but then they really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there is something happening .
and i thought , &quot; wait a moment , this sounds interesting . &quot;
i went to cambridge , and i realized very slowly , so these kids actually put a little bit .
i did a little bit interested in talking with a familiar familiar with the met , and actually , it turns out to be a game called <unk> , where a goose gets beaten up with a stick .
it seemed to be very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it .
to get really close to it , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you all of you , i &apos;m going to see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best part is coming in .
let me jump back at moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
by the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what it &apos;s like , when you want to see , van gogh this masterpiece , created ?
you put in <unk> . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorite images of this picture , until i &apos;m really touching it .
this is <unk> , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s still many , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s collections .
each of you , every -- whether it &apos;s rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
they can go ahead and online their own museum -- from all these images , they can put their own collection .
just easy , go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it means the power of <unk> -- you can <unk> .
that &apos;s the <unk> &apos; 50s .
you can put all things with notes , your friends , and so you start to talk about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , in conclusion , the main thing to me is that all the wonderful things here are not coming from google .
and i think it &apos;s not even the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a humbling experience for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to talk to this digital medium of art , and they represent a fair online .
and the next question i &apos;ve been asked to ask you now , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s going to add the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a picture of your brain . your brain can split into two halves .
that &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side and then the rights , which is the intuitive .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of every hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
for example , this one would be completely logical .
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
some of us might have thought of one of this extreme , but i think that , for most people in the audience , their brain looks like this -- with a high <unk> , which is at the same time .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive , or anything like that .
they can be logical and intuitively .
and so i see myself as one of the people in common with the other experimental <unk> that need a good component to add the ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good component to really do to do experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to deal with things .
so we go out and play it , and then look at it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that they &apos;ve been developing for years is probably , that a thing can be only in the same time .
i mean , it sounds strange to think that one thing is in the same time in two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they developed it .
i remember seeing a child playing on a <unk> .
he was still a toddler and not very good at it , and it constantly <unk> .
but i bet you played this with a very valuable lesson that teaches us a very valuable lesson , which is that great things can not just pass over and that they stay on .
and this is a great <unk> model in the world , so long as they &apos;re not a <unk> .
it would be a horrible model for <unk> , because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little strange particles .
and when you play with your particles , you &apos;re going to play all kinds of odd things -- how you &apos;re flying through walls , or you can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the physics of some years ago ; you needed a quantum mechanics to describe the small , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t have to use them to describe the great mundane objects around us .
it didn &apos;t enjoy my intuition , and it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t even play with things like particles .
well , i play sometimes with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle .
but my <unk> didn &apos;t enjoy it .
because if all of the things out of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , then not all the rules of doing quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it &apos;s not supposed to be .
so , i would feel a little bit better with the whole thing , if we could show it that <unk> can also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a couple of years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object that you can see , in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer .
and you can see this green spot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is an image of the object .
so , i &apos;ll zoom into this . we &apos;re looking at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really very small close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a small piece of metal it &apos;s shaped like a springboard , and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way that you make a computer .
i went to a <unk> public space with new <unk> , and <unk> <unk> for all of these big devices .
for the last little , i had to build my own machine -- in order to get this kind of <unk> pool and <unk> the thing .
this thing has got the ability to be in the <unk> , but it takes a little bit of help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;m going to do all kinds of odd things , but then people will add to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to bother to do this , because , frankly , they said , <unk> .
quantum mechanics says the <unk> objects can feel like that .
the <unk> of <unk> objects are not just people , but the light that seems to you , and the wind , which it seems to you , and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal <unk> behaves , we needed to get the whole <unk> out of <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we switched off the light , put it in a vacuum , and <unk> it all the air , and it <unk> it almost to her now , just in the elevator alone , just as usual .
so we measured the movement .
we found that it really turns out to be strange .
instead of just that it &apos;s just quiet , it <unk> it . the way it was <unk> like something like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
in fact , we gave it a little push , we could make it <unk> at the same time , and not to vibrate , something that just allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what is fantastic .
what does it mean for an object at the same time and <unk> them ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> of atoms made the piece of metal are still there , and at the same time , the same atoms are going on and down the same atoms .
you know , equally accurate matching voices .
the rest of the time are <unk> .
that means that every atom at the same time is two different places , which is at the same time that the whole piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me all this year into this clean space , because , you know , the <unk> between one single atom and this piece of metal is about just as the difference between the piece of metal and yours .
so if a single atom can be in the same time in two different places , can play this piece of metal in two different places , why don &apos;t you ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical point is .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time in different places , how would that feel like ?
how would your mind communicating that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we put it out , the lights on the box and the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in there .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in fact are just objects that are together in a small space that &apos;s together .
you hear a lot of talks about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more beyond that , it &apos;s still deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around you , literally define who you are , and this is the <unk> and weird quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be <unk> , as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they live and work , to give them the opportunity to choose between at least one hand of different cities that are all facing in new places .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in the developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city that they would welcome to .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are so much more than it costs them .
so we could just bring the world very easily , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound as absurd as if you &apos;ve never been thinking about new cities .
but they just trading the building out of cities from cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes are done , but they &apos;re not yet .
you could try to expand the capacity of existing existing apartments .
but you know what they were going to be there to be in these homes and whose environment are laws to prevent complaints , avoiding the pipeline .
so it turns out to be very difficult to get all of these extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place , building a new new block block , assuming the laws would provide and build it .
so i &apos;ve proposed that governments will create new spaces that provide enough place for a city , and give them a name : <unk> cities .
later , i discovered that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> about the challenge of reform in honduras .
they knew that every year , they were about 1990 to meet their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country , and can be the same same honduras .
at this point , <unk> <unk> said , &quot; what happens when we put a <unk> land of our country , what if we just want to go out of one message from the american embassy , a part of the canadian embassy , &quot; and then the people of the world will be doing .
in the summer of 2009 , honduras was under a severe conflict .
next to election , election election , <unk> <unk> entered in a <unk> whose program both new innovations .
he asked <unk> to be <unk> .
in the meantime , i was preparing for a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , testing and testing of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of the city of the city city .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you have already supposed to be <unk> .
we pay attention to new technologies , but for progress , we need technology and laws , and they are usually laws that are to return us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala <unk> the link to the tedtalk .
and again , he showed him <unk> .
they were two on me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s go back to the head of our country . &quot;
so we met in december of the hotels of miami in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make it clear to how valuable cities are much more valuable than they &apos;re spending .
and i used this graph to show how valuable value is in a place like new york , think of that area , in some cases , there &apos;s thousands of dollars worth of dollars .
but it was a fairly abstract discussion , at a place when there was a pause , said , &quot; paul , maybe we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk , in a very simple form , is that a <unk> city is a place where the first <unk> land is a place where the law determines the laws and the people determine the possibility either or not in those rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of honduras , who meant that we needed to build this project that matters , and that &apos;s the way we can bring our country forward .
i was asked to come to <unk> , and i was asked to speak to the fourth and the fifth of january .
so , i &apos;ve given one another couple of facts , which is a graph like this one , which is trying to illustrate , that if you want to make a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch is the new airport that &apos;s built in <unk> .
in this airport , there was a surface of 100 miles .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the fact that if you want to build a new city , you need to start with an area of mit at least 1,000 dollars .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
please speak all the <unk> .
the faces of the audience was very seriously and carefully .
the head of congress came to the stage , and he said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe i could look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they put the tedtalk .
and i came to the statement that a new city gives new opportunities to people .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in honduras , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city includes new opportunities for leaders .
the leaders of the united states would be based on <unk> aid , they could benefit from their <unk> , who they could take on the charter for the charter , and in that agreement that everybody will actually catch it .
and the realization of president <unk> was that the <unk> of the news that i thought was a way to get out of foreign investment to build and build this city equivalent to all of those parties in honduras that have been suffering from fear and mistrust .
we &apos;re in an area .
this picture is from this place .
it sums up a thousand square miles .
and shortly after , on the 19th of january , they voted for the change for the constitution , to have a <unk> policy that stands for specific <unk> .
in a country that has been a violent crisis in 2009 , in congress voted for elected <unk> to vote .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be twice twice after congress .
february 17th , it became a second <unk> with a <unk> website .
immediately after that election , between the 21st , and in 24 , a delegation of about 30 <unk> were the two locations to the two places that were most interested in getting into the business of business .
the place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city , which is built in south korea <unk> big than the urban center .
everything that you can see in this picture was built in four years when it took four years to get the permissions .
the other place that was very interested in conservation architecture is singapore .
they &apos;ve been built two cities in china and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re really thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a <unk> , and you think about that area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a system that involves <unk> , and it also works on a legal system .
a country has written at the supreme court according to the <unk> of the local calling <unk> on this <unk> system .
also , <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even take funding out .
one thing about you already realized , there are a lot of <unk> .
there are a lot of businesses that would love to happen in america , especially at one place to a <unk> , and there are a lot of people who would love to live there .
all over the world , 700 million people who tell them that they would like to live to live in a different place .
a million people are going to go and latin america to the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to keep their families to be educated , sometimes they have single mothers who need enough money to earn food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes , kids are trying to find their parents back , they have , in some cases , have seen more than a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about it in honduras for a completely new city ?
or even building cities from these cities , are building hundreds and hundreds of thousands around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to have that every family has a choice between a lot of cities that are at the new competition ?
this is an idea that spreads to spread .
my friends from honduras have asked me to thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i recently had a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices , the average american average of a day is a <unk> american day .
and also , a recent study has been done with ceos who were watching the nobel week .
and these scientists have just documented the various subjects that these ceo are busy doing , and how much time they were making decisions that relate to topics .
and they &apos;ve found that the average ceo of the time is working with <unk> tasks .
each of these subjects consisted of many , many smaller choices .
50 percent of their decisions have been achieved within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions they needed an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes categories is at an hour ?
how good do you think you &apos;re in terms of dealing with these decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem , some of the possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , please , because i &apos;m blind , just if you want to burn some calories .
but , if i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , my first question for today is : are you willing to hear anything about that ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very <unk> store , at least time , he was really exclusive .
it was a store called <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually had <unk> <unk> .
i loved it to go to this business , but at a time i wondered , well , how do you get something wrong ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had 40 different kinds of olive oil , including those that were locked in boxes , that came from a thousand years ago .
so i decided to go to the leader seat , and i asked the leader , &quot; does this model model that you would really bring all of these kinds of opportunities ? &quot;
and he showed up on the <unk> of tourists who had every day and they had their cameras around .
we decided to do a experiment , and we chose the experiment for our experiment .
here &apos;s her <unk> gear .
they had <unk> different types of <unk> .
we put a little <unk> directly at the entrance to the <unk> .
we &apos;ve got six different tastes <unk> , or <unk> different kinds of tastes <unk> , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , what would you get more and more people ?
there are more people left when it was about 60 percent than when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what was the people who made a glass of <unk> .
now we saw the opposite effect .
people were standing up to the people when they were 24 , they just had three percent of <unk> .
by the people who were standing when they were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of <unk> .
well , if you calculate it , the people would have six times more like a <unk> , who had six to choice , when they had 24 choices .
well , not to decide not to put a glass of <unk> , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our comfort -- but it turns out that <unk> changes us in very different ways .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even if it comes against our own best interests .
so , the issue of day is saving .
i &apos;m going to tell you a study that i conducted with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , who we gave ourselves the choices for the <unk> of the entire united states , from about a <unk> of all of the united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of <unk> , which was one possible possible that would be possible , the <unk> plan that affects the future if it will be saved tomorrow .
and what we found was that there was a relationship .
so in this plans , we had about <unk> plans to give people about anything between two to 59 percent .
and what we found was that the more fund became more than that , in fact , the attendance rate was less .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that gave the <unk> , the <unk> , had a <unk> in the <unk> -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that cost almost 60 , it <unk> down to about <unk> <unk> .
now it turns out that even if you &apos;re engaged in choice , even more choices for choice , even it &apos;s got unintended consequences .
so the people who decided to participate in the more , more than the more possibilities they were , the more that they were going to be <unk> and <unk> .
the more possibilities they were , the more they put their whole money on pure <unk> .
none of these extreme choices , is to make people &apos;s decisions that people would expect if their future financial well-being is important .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve been able to see three crucial negative <unk> that offer that more and more choices .
they make the decision -- they push up , even if it &apos;s against their own best interest .
they make more decisions and worse decisions and worse health care .
they &apos;re going to choose to do things that they make themselves less <unk> , even if they make it objective .
the main reason for this is that we might enjoy <unk> these big shelves full of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but in fact , we can &apos;t use the comparison and limiting , and then can actually make anything out of the fantastic offer .
so what i want to suggest today is four basic techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve been testing in different species and various studies -- they can use them in business .
first of all , just narrow .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true of the world today .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; narrow . &quot;
they &apos;re always going to worry about losing them .
but in truth , we see more and more , that if they &apos;re willing to narrow , and the <unk> of opportunities are going on , well , there &apos;s a rise of sales , it will increase the &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a <unk> improvement .
as <unk> and gamble <unk> the different head and <unk> species added up to 26 , they got a rise of sales to 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> corporation told her 10 to the worst <unk> <unk> , they experienced that the yields around the 87 percent increase in sales -- a result of both , the increase in sales and reducing reduction .
you know , the average average student today , offers 20 million products .
a typical wal-mart walmart today &apos;s 100,000 products .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is now a <unk> supermarket in the world , <unk> , and they &apos;re giving them only more products -- a kind of tomato sauce , in the fluids .
now in the world of <unk> , i think one of the best examples that come out of the market , how far the best choices are , was something that has led to the very <unk> , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered to harvard .
every single harvard employees now automatically provided to a <unk> part .
the ones who want to make a selection , they &apos;re investing in 2010 , not to fund or 70 .
you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to narrow it .
it &apos;s all important things . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the difference can be different from each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t smoke them , they won &apos;t be their own . &quot;
now , before we started this morning , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to take all the people in this audience to the most beautiful road to the most beautiful road in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read you about it .
and now i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i ask them to clap when they &apos;re willing to assume .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to get gary &apos;s offer .
are they all ?
all right , let me show you something more .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
good .
in fact , you look at it , when i first had more information , once in the second time , but i would expect it to guess that they felt real time on the second time .
because those images made it for real real sense .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of <unk> , which is the <unk> .
it &apos;s about telling people to understand the difference between ways , to understand what the consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that these consequences have to be intense and specific to feel about it .
why are people spending about 15 to 30 percent more if they &apos;re using a <unk> card or a credit card than in cash ?
because it &apos;s not what we &apos;re living .
and it turns out that if you make it feel that it feels a bit of it , it &apos;s a very good tool for saving people to save more .
so , in a study i did with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we did a study with people who were done in <unk> -- and they had all been involved in a meeting where they signed their participation .
and during this meeting , we have this gathering right now , as it was always , only we added a little bit .
the small thing we have with <unk> was that we asked people to just think about all of the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
in the way that we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation by 20 percent , and there was a spike of the number of people who were willing to save , and increase a increase in four percent , and they were ready for numbers of numbers .
third technology : <unk> .
we can better deal with more categories than more choices .
here &apos;s an example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a <unk> .
it turns out that there &apos;s the <unk> up to the top up and down in the northeast area , the number between <unk> <unk> different types of magazines up to <unk> .
but you know what ?
when i show you 600 months , and you put them in 10 categories or i show you 400 magazines , and you put it in 20 categories , and then you believe that i gave them more choice , and i gave them 400 -- if i gave them 600 .
because the categories would tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; jazz . &quot;
if you think that the left page is <unk> , and the ad on the right is jazz , then clap , in the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that on the left is jazz , and the one on the right side is <unk> , then they clap , please .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they have right .
the one on the left is jazz , and the <unk> is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a <unk> <unk> .
the categories must be saying something that doesn &apos;t give the choice .
and this is a problem , often , when you look at the long list lists .
who are going to really inform them ?
my fourth technology : the complexity of complexity .
it turns out that we can actually handle more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to slow down complexity .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very simple decision : take the car for a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> , who gives you the opportunity to take your car completely off .
they have to make several different kinds of choices to design their car completely .
now , these decisions are in terms of choices that they offer per choice .
<unk> , <unk> of the cars -- i have 56 options .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i do now is change the order of making decisions .
half of the people is going to be from the many possibilities , <unk> us in the very few possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the customers are from the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how do they care .
when they use the <unk> of the decision , that means that you &apos;re being overwhelmed , the <unk> , i lose it .
what they &apos;re finding is that the people who come from the very low to these low income policies are always going to choose .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then they stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is the sequence that &apos;s presented to this information .
when i start with the simple , i &apos;m learning how to do .
even even though the wheel chooses to make me know nothing about my preferences in the interior , that still takes me to choose .
it &apos;s also <unk> me excited about the big product that i &apos;m going to do , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate it to become an interest .
let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that can reduce the problem of <unk> -- -- are you going to narrow the alternative alternatives . let &apos;s do it real ; we can make more <unk> categories , less possibilities , complexity .
so , those of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the possibility -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for people who provide service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re not choosing choice .
and the more we choose to choose to choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of justice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> , <unk> . youtube , i look at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how to do video videos , and then what &apos;s really important about it .
we want to be stars , <unk> , singers , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed to be so difficult .
but <unk> <unk> allows us that all of us or all of our creative activities are going to be famous for part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next day .
but in youtube , they &apos;re uploaded to 48 hours per hour .
again , again , a tiny percentage of <unk> are ever seen and thousands of times and looked at thousands of cultural moments .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> , the unexpected .
well , then we want .
oh my god . oh my gosh .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> this video that filmed in his national national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this graph shows how it looked like when the video last summer was very popular .
in fact , nobody wanted to do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re going to do that as if you have <unk> trees .
he had uploaded a whole lot of <unk> .
and this video was actually been sent on january .
what happened here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet , the video that &apos;s played so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> gives us new and interesting things , and show them a great audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> down on <unk> , <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , etc .
rebecca <unk> : &quot; <unk> &quot; is one of the popular popular video .
it was nearly 200 million times .
this is what the picture looked like .
just like the &quot; <unk> , &quot; it seems to come out of nowhere .
what happened on this day ?
well , it was friday , it was right .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> it , lots of blogs started to write about it .
michael <unk> nelson &apos;s the <unk> science theater was a first person who was doing a joke about twitter .
what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of <unk> would have a point of view with a large audience , and that was accelerating the process .
and then community community came together with these large <unk> , and they started talking about it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 miles away from youtube .
in the first seven days , there was a spoof for every single day of day .
unlike the magnificent conversation of the 20th century , the participation of the community is to become our way part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; animation is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , just simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you &apos;d know that there &apos;s been a <unk> that has taken four million times .
even cats are looking at this video .
cats don &apos;t look at cats watching this video .
what &apos;s important is , creativity , the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
there were <unk> .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole member of <unk> took out of the floor that made it a silly joke about something that we could all participate in .
today we don &apos;t just get pleasure with something that we &apos;re doing with .
who could have any of this ?
who could have the &quot; double &quot; <unk> , &quot; rebecca <unk> or <unk> ?
what kind of <unk> would be able to write into where things were <unk> ?
in a world where every minute of two days of video will be uploaded , only really unique , and unexpected <unk> like the videos .
i admit i didn &apos;t care very much when i was a friend saying , i should look at this great video , about a guy who has been protesting in new york for parking .
i got a ticket ticket , because i didn &apos;t get to the <unk> , but there are a disability that doesn &apos;t let you go down to the <unk> .
and this was completely surprising and humorous was a casey <unk> that thought he was looking at five million times .
this is true of all of what we &apos;re creative .
and that brings us to a big question .
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative creative game , totally unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that has access to the public <unk> .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber &apos;s first -- made his youtube at youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas to green ideas .
and today , we &apos;re all comfortable as the <unk> of our pop culture .
and these are not the characteristics of old media , and they &apos;re hardly to look at the media today , but they will define the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk to 10 minutes talking to women &apos;s three generations , and how the astonishing strength of that connectedness was in a <unk> girl , when she had a little <unk> girl , her day and her <unk> sleep in a little boat .
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle , which is still composed .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece , a man who burns his life &apos;s burned .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was held together by the simple hope of unity and freedom of its home .
hold it to the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> , to see the fact that his life has been a single waste .
the words , the long time , his friends , <unk> now .
he moved into the silence .
he died , broken by history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never told me his life .
i had to worry that it was not free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to <unk> us , but we were out there .
the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> are <unk> on <unk> .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died , died in a marriage marriage , had two little girls .
for her life , her life was asked : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely <unk> that it could fail .
after a four year-old and <unk> <unk> , a boat stopped on the sea as the <unk> disguised .
all adults are aware of the risks .
the biggest fear of them was <unk> , rape and death .
like most of the adults on the boat , my mother wore a little <unk> .
if you had a <unk> , my sister would have my sister and myself and then <unk> my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the continuous <unk> of the engine , the <unk> of a wave on the front , the long and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that come and lots of times , but remember from the <unk> of men on our boat , or on the <unk> of the engine , who was six hours not going to start .
but i remember the lights on the <unk> of the coast of the coast , and the young man who collapsed , and died , the end of the journey was too much for him and , for the taste of the first <unk> that i had one of the men on the platform .
no apple never tasted again .
after three months in a refugee camp we arrived in melbourne .
and the next session is about four women in three generations , together to build a new life .
we settled in <unk> , one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , whose population is made out of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was completely unknown , there was no <unk> <unk> .
the smell of the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> <unk> had been shared between people that had one thing in common : they started fresh .
my mother worked on a farm , and then on a line of <unk> , six days , six layers .
they managed to find their time to learn english and <unk> english .
we were poor .
each dollars was approved , and they got involved in literacy in english and math , no matter what we had to do with -- mostly the things that were getting turned out .
two <unk> <unk> for school , each , to cover the holes in the other .
one <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to reach six years .
and there were the rare ones , painful <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and here and <unk> <unk> : &quot; asian , goes home . &quot;
where ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting of reconciliation , and a calm voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to walk out of the way . &quot;
my mom , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted all night , but we told each other from our day , and heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake overnight , until their <unk> came in , so i could <unk> them .
she opened a <unk> , then a <unk> and then created a business .
and the women came to their stories about men who don &apos;t change the <unk> , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , trapped between two worlds .
loans and donors were looking for .
centers have been built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic asian student , the <unk> requirements of himself .
in the other i was involved in unsafe life , the tragic scars of violence , the <unk> and the insulation .
but there were so many people over the years .
and of course , i was going to <unk> in this last year when the <unk> <unk> of the year .
and i was <unk> from one of the nearest time , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le <unk> <unk> <unk> , was now le le , refugee , social activist , who traveled to the places that they never heard , and in housing , whose existence they could never imagined .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go to the routine , and the convenience of life from a unknown unknown -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , each one of their days as two years old , and they told each other the stories of their day and told them three , and they were still in the same bed .
i said , i didn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was now old as she was when we had the boat .
no , it was never a way .
&quot; do it easy , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the neglect of <unk> and <unk> .
and the more i talked about , the more i should tell .
i met people in all <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , lived in the borders of the possible .
and even though i had graduated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t find my career in a school .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized that at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , <unk> in the picture -- and not just okay , but something that you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of <unk> .
because <unk> can easily be able to move to the arena of gravity , so it can mean that easy for the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;m now enough of my <unk> to know that , yes , the world is <unk> , but not as it <unk> .
opportunities that were not allowed , explicitly encouraged .
there was a energy , an optimism optimism , a strange <unk> of the humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my gut .
i collected a little team of people around me , which is not a very challenging challenge .
for a year we didn &apos;t have a cent .
at the end of one night , i was cooking a big bag of soup that we shared .
we worked very late until night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were some brilliant ones , and we managed to make the breakthrough .
i made the decision to go to the united states .
after all of that journey .
my gut gut again .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
before i talk to this talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when the <unk> , the social norm and the other speaker was the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother <unk> her .
with 17 , she became the second woman of a mandarin , she told her mother .
without the support of her husband , she was paying for her <unk> , by bringing him into court , and she had a larger <unk> when she won .
&quot; he &apos;s not <unk> .
i was sitting in a hotel room in a hotel room in sydney , when she died , 1,000 kilometers from in melbourne .
i looked around the <unk> and looked at the other side .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
my mother called me a couple of minutes .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her <unk> .
we told their stories , and we told them that we were in their own .
at midnight , he came from the monk and said he had to close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
she asked the monk : &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you ? &quot;
&quot; because she said , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; you didn &apos;t shut it up . &quot;
if there &apos;s a bond in our family , it comes through the women .
you see who we were , and how life evolved us , we can see that the men that might have come to our lives , have gotten into <unk> .
the defeat would have been simply .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i still remember the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yes , i fear fear , <unk> , <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life that <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> horizon , which is no doubt ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this and it safely safely , i would do it .
and also , <unk> mother is here in the fourth or the fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography ?
because , of course , this is an image you can &apos;t pick with your camera .
but nevertheless , my interest in photography when i first got my first digital camera , at age 15 .
i put it with my previous <unk> sweetheart , but it was a little bit different , because using the camera , it was rather than planning .
and if you take a picture at the camera with a camera , the process starts hitting the trigger .
so to me , photography seemed to be more about to be at the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts when it triggers the trigger .
photos like this : a construction site on a much <unk> road .
but it was a unexpected twist .
and still , an realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all of the common goal of keeping a realistic level .
when i say reality , my <unk> .
because , of course , isn &apos;t something you can capture , but i just want to look it like this , as if you could have this , you can see in a photo .
you know , photos that you have to think about a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s really about trying to capture an idea as a moment .
but what is the trick that makes realistic realistic ?
is it all the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what does the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i look at them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put it together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
so we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all identify with a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , together , you can create something that will look back in the dimensions than it could exist .
but at the same time we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brains are simply simply not to make sense of it .
and i see the same process of combining photographs .
it &apos;s really about trying to combine different realities .
so the things that make a look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
but if we combine some photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you just look pretty wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , these are not three special pictures .
but also , you can do something special like this .
so the first rule is that different photographs should have the same perspective .
second , one of them should have combined the same <unk> .
and these two pictures fulfilling these two requirements -- out of the same altitude and taken the same <unk> .
and third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to tell you where the individual images begin and end by connecting them seamlessly .
does it impossible to say how this photograph was put together .
so by using color , contrast and brightness on the edges , the <unk> images , photographic frames <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> colors , and <unk> , <unk> the lines between the various images and then see how a single picture can actually have hundreds of levels of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom is <unk> .
but this picture is actually composed of reality , from photographs of different places .
i personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place to create a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise in ideas with his ideas .
but it takes a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed months to take them to plan to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> .
the shore is coming from a different place .
the <unk> is made by a quarry .
and yes , i even put the house up on the island in red <unk> to make it look back out .
so to get a <unk> result , it &apos;s from a way that comes from me from planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of various different images .
and here &apos;s a very <unk> plan .
and when you get good pictures , the result can be pretty beautiful , and it &apos;s quite realistic .
so it &apos;s all available tools , and the only thing that is limited , it &apos;s our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why this is a lot of electronic <unk> .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped hearing with our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced to the <unk> was to do a <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work very well -- well she takes a cup of coffee or tea , and says , &quot; patients , relatives , relatives , &quot; how is it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of you -- maybe most of the electronic growth fail , because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
she has a button there .
and every morning i jump .
and yes , i have a task , as you might recognize .
i have my job with 95 pounds .
it just works : every time i put on the scale , then you send my data on google health .
and there &apos;s also , from the <unk> of the <unk> , so that he can see where my <unk> is , and that &apos;s not just the moment where i need for support , or for a look at the past .
but there &apos;s still something .
maybe you &apos;ve known that , i have over 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i jump into my <unk> and people who talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; for lunch is a little bit of a cute salad today . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that can happen , because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it might be given patients at smoking .
it could also be used to get people out of their chairs and getting them to do in a kind of game to control their health .
next week , this is coming in the market .
there &apos;s this little <unk> that will be on an iphone or something like that .
and it will allow people to reach out of home to home their blood pressure , and send it to their doctor , for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
and at that point , the patients come in . they can &apos;t take over the control , the captain on their own ship , but also helps us help help health care as well as the health quality of healthcare , twice and demand .
do some ways to use it , and begin to embrace patients at the team .
and they can do it through these ways , but also by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you a quick video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all the atm machines are around around .
we still know one where the gas stations are .
and we know , we can find <unk> .
but where is the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and no one knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving <unk> was in that moment .
so , what did we do ? we did crowdsource in the netherlands .
we put a website on a website , and he asked a <unk> , &quot; if you can see a <unk> , please share with him when he &apos;s up , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed as well , of course .
and over 10,000 days were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps .
and we designed a design system .
we have developed an app for <unk> , <unk> reality , to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , and someone is collapsing , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , you can find your <unk> , can save life .
and today , we don &apos;t just want to do this as <unk> as a product called product as well as well as well .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like <unk> , to help these <unk> <unk> around the world .
and if you &apos;re in holiday and someone &apos;s collapse , it &apos;s your own relationships , or somebody else , you can see this as a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies all over the world are helping us help by giving up these <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or a technician for example , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still in its place .
please help us , and try to improve the health of nature not only to improve it .
thank you .
today , i &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
i work in <unk> .
and my little <unk> wanted to make it that we force for protecting the environment by doing ...
it &apos;s giving the heed .
here &apos;s a short video of what we &apos;re doing .
oh . a moment .
it may take it until it load .
now -- we can just jump in -- i &apos;m just going to skip the video to you .
no .
this is not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to launch the stars in technology and design to take a year sabbatical and work in a environment that is really quite what they hate , we have them working in the government .
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a bit like the <unk> <unk> .
we choose some fellows every year , and we let them work with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into <unk> .
and they developed great apps , working with urban collaborators .
but what they really do is to show what &apos;s possible with technology today .
so , they meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city of boston .
this is what he looks like to look for a date , but what he really is looking for somebody is <unk> when he knows , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at <unk> if it &apos;s <unk> by a <unk> snow .
how did he come up looking for this particular way ?
we had a team of writers in boston in the course of the code for america .
they were in february , and it &apos;s last last week .
and they found that the city never <unk> the fire fires .
but one particular fellow , the guy named erik <unk> , she found a little bit different , and that was , people have pushed public sidewalks in front of these parts .
so he did what any good designer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app , where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you <unk> him to <unk> , when it &apos;s <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do it , you can take someone away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the linux apps that have been called the fellows in the last year .
but she does something you don &apos;t do anything else .
it &apos;s rapidly expanding .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> section of the city who &apos;s seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizen leaders .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> are working , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the people to test them .
and then decided decided to use seattle to get the citizens to get <unk> <unk> .
and chicago was just introduced them to <unk> the people when the <unk> <unk> .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and it has always been <unk> , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know that normally doesn &apos;t normally go .
the <unk> of software takes a few years in the rule .
we had a team that was working on a project in boston for three months and a half months .
it was about a way that parents can figure out what the right public school are for their children .
and then it tells us that if it was going to go through the normal canals , it took about two years , it would have been about about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing at all .
there &apos;s a project in the field of california , which is the cost to cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at any level of government .
so one app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then spreading by <unk> , is a kind of shot at the institution of the government .
she shows how the government might work better at -- not more like a private company , how many people think it should be .
and not even like a <unk> , but like the internet itself .
and it means free access to that means that and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that she represents a new generation , which is the issue of government -- not as the problem of a <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out that we are very good in creating collective technology .
now there &apos;s a large community of people who make the tools that we need to do things effectively together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people around the country who are getting up and writing , everyday , everyday in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about them , fix them .
and these people know something that we lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all have your feelings about politics and the line at the <unk> and all the other things that we &apos;re really upset about is government , in the core , in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; what we do in the world . &quot;
today , a lot of people have given up .
and if you are one of the people , i urge you to think about it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is changing .
and because the government ultimately takes their power out of us -- <unk> you , &quot; we have the people ? &quot; -- how we think about how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought , in the government , mainly that people are going to choose a office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that there is a lot of communities that go around .
that &apos;s the call call service service and information .
you usually get out when you put your estate in your town .
if you ever have the chance to be in your <unk> call , like our fellow scott <unk> as a part of the program -- in fact , do you all , you know , people who are going to call out the government because there are many <unk> problems in your house .
scott , gets this <unk> .
he sounds like &quot; <unk> &quot; on the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he &apos;s starting with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can open all the doors in your house and see very noisy music and see if the animal <unk> ? &quot;
and it worked . applause for scott .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
now , boston is not just a call call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we have not written this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of new york city in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- that came in &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get away ? &quot;
but what happens with <unk> <unk> is different .
scott went from man to man .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is so public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it was a neighbor .
and the next entry we &apos;ve got was , &quot; i went over there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
turned down the <unk> . went home .
good night , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . this is the digital <unk> .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government gets in the crowdsourcing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean my industrial definition .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped support other citizens , but the government played a key role .
they connected these two people .
and you could have been able to connect them with <unk> , if it needed to be , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to state services .
if a neighbor helps the other helps we strengthen our communities .
we call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about this government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand it , but they believe that one was the input from the other .
that our contribution to our system is .
how often we have chosen political policy -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy to pick up a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;ll expect that the government changes our values and our needs , and it doesn &apos;t have much difference ?
this is because the government is a wider ocean , and politics are the top of the top .
and what &apos;s it is , what we call a bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this kind of contempt , the one that we have , and we pay them to be something that &apos;s against us , something else , and then <unk> us ourselves .
people seem to think that politics is sexy .
if we want that institution for us , we need to make the sexy thing .
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> is happening .
we need to deal with the <unk> of the government .
so the <unk> did it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned people who wrote a very detailed detailed report that has a response to the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> .
this is not politically active , this is <unk> active .
well , for those of us who have given up government , it &apos;s time we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you &apos;ve got to introduce you the enormous challenges you need to imagine .
do we really believe that we can achieve what we need to achieve without creating an institution that can be in the name of us all ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of the government is essentially <unk> in a way that can actually achieve something by supporting society .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the right systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i am , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of them are .
this is a generation that grew up to see their voice , of course .
they don &apos;t fight this fight that we &apos;re all fighting fighting , who is allowed to talk to .
you can comment on your head at any time , and you do it .
so , when you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , don &apos;t worry about how you &apos;re using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write uses that work improves in the government .
and these apps allow us to use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be , a fire of fire <unk> , planting a trash of a trash .
and sure enough , we could have these <unk> fire all the time , and a lot of people do that .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we are not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of taxes that are paying taxes and services .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we make the citizenship citizenship .
so the question i ask for all of you : when it &apos;s about the big , important things we need to do together , we will only be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
and what i mean , my role is to explain people like this new technologies that are going to be the emergence , and i thought to myself , and i &apos;m going to tell you what i really believe .
i &apos;m going to start with you just a little bit of boring slides .
... if you &apos;ll just show you the slide .
this is a slide that i selected by my <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you the details of this slide , rather than the general form .
this slide shows data by analyzing the performance of <unk> processors compared to the power of a <unk> area .
now the interesting thing here is that this slide , like many others , which we find , in our field , are sort of a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is equivalent of a power in the <unk> .
and this is a novelty , that we need to use this type of <unk> on <unk> curves in technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the lights back .
something slightly brighter , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit on the paper here .
now why do we draw graphs in the <unk> of <unk> curves ?
the reason for that , if i draw it on a normal curve , where , let &apos;s say , this is the years , so the timeline of technology that i want to use with a graph , and then the graph is silly .
so this is what it looks like .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then it would be very <unk> on the <unk> scale , in a form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens , this changes change conditions .
so if the <unk> would be so fast as the incremental progression would be , then we could get into a taxi car , and we could be in a 30 seconds in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
there was never before , in the history of <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which is growing exponentially .
so the question i want to ask you now is , if you look at this exponential curves , you see , they don &apos;t go forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is changing so fast and so forth .
there are two options .
it &apos;s either going to be a classic <unk> version like this , to something completely new , and it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s it .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is something like this is going to happen .
so , that &apos;s really , that means we are right now in a transition .
we are here on this line , in a transition from the world &apos;s world , to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i often think of myself , is how this new world is going to be ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the way it seems to be very , very confusing , when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people talked about what was going to happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference here where people talk about the future , and you find that the future is still in 2000 .
we don &apos;t go beyond that .
so in other words , the future has declined since a year i &apos;ve been around in this world .
i think the reason for that is that we realize there is something happening .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
and we know that it &apos;s simply not to make a sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because it &apos;s going to be so different , that it &apos;s a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing now is not making sense .
so i want to talk about what this could be , this transition transition that we are in right now .
and to do this first , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t do with technology or computers .
because i think in order to really understand this , we need to go back and look at one of a long time thinking .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;d like to look at this on the <unk> of life on earth &apos;s life .
i think the big picture makes sense , when you split it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and it took us two billion years ago , the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals .
now if you think about how the chemicals were organized , then this gives us a pretty good picture about how it &apos;s going on .
i think there are theories that begin to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simple story about what this is that this little bit of <unk> <unk> had different types of chemicals in the chemicals .
some of these <unk> includes a special combination of chemicals , which allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside , and grow up .
all of them were , they started .
these little <unk> were in the sense of <unk> <unk> .
but they weren &apos;t living as much as lives in today , because each one of them was only a small , <unk> prescription of chemicals .
and every time it shared , it turns out that there are <unk> chemicals in the other .
so every time was a bit different .
in fact , the <unk> grew , which led to the growth of the chemistry , faster faster than others and integrated different from the outside and shared .
so those tend to survive , to survive , and they <unk> into an extent .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting it is that if you were able to learn a trick about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t understand , we have this <unk> of the ability to learn information .
they have learned to deliver the recipe for the cell to information , and in a specific chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they learned in these <unk> , evolutionary way , found a way that allowed them to allow them to be stored and be copied this information .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information can store information for about 2.5 billion years where it was made up .
in fact , the recipe for us , is our genes , from the exact same code , and the same notation .
and every organism is using the same same word and the same code .
we are out there , we &apos;re just capable of writing ourselves in this code .
and i have 100 years of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to keep in the airports of the airports .
and it &apos;s inside -- and what i did is , i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use -- and i put my <unk> on a piece of dna , and it has 10 ^ 22 times .
so if you give a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough enough for everybody in this room and even everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was a <unk> , i would have put it on a virus and put it in space .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of the dna was an interesting step .
and these cells do this -- they made it happy for another billion years .
but then another thing , a very interesting step , where things were completely different , and so they began to communicate these cells and communicate information , so that communities evolved from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew it , but bacteria can actually share your dna .
that &apos;s why , for example , the consistency is antibiotics too .
some bacteria have figured out how to stay away from penicillin and have this information combined with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have lots of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
now this communication allowed me to organize communities , which in a sense of the same boat , they were <unk> .
so they did either survive , or they went together , and that meant that when a community was successful , the individuals were perceived more and more of the individuals .
now , the <unk> is now where the communities are so close to the <unk> that they &apos;re decided to write the recipe for the whole community into the <unk> .
and the next interesting thing was about a billion billion years .
at that point , we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which combined as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a such community community .
we have a lot of cells , which are <unk> anymore .
your skin cells are useless <unk> cells , muscle cells , cells , and so on .
so these communities started <unk> , so the level that was happening on the ground , not longer the individual cell , but the entire <unk> of what we call organism .
the next step happened in these communities .
the <unk> started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures , which made nothing else to process than information in the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that have this <unk> structure .
they started training early specialists in the community , special structures , who were responsible for learning and understanding that information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of the communities .
and they gave them a evolutionary advantage .
because at that time , an individual -- learning happened in the span of time of a single organism , rather than about this evolutionary period .
so an organism could learn how to eat a particular fruit , because they didn &apos;t get bad , and he got sick , the last time he ate it .
so this could be possible in the lifespan of a single organism , whereas before hundreds of thousands of years , it had to be learned from the individuals that died of these individuals , because of these cancers , there were no longer there .
so the nervous system has the mechanical system through this specialized process , because evolution could be within an individual .
it could be within a period of time .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
as an example , the <unk> of the most famous technology is the human language .
but it &apos;s a pretty compelling invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;ve basically selected <unk> of the notes that i think of a very confused idea in your head , which has some kind of resemblance to my original idea .
so we &apos;re going to take a very complicated , convert it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as an individual organism .
and what we actually did is we think of ourselves , we have to abstract .
we &apos;re going through the same stages , which have gone through <unk> -- the abstraction of our methods that we can present with .
the invention of language , it was a little step in this direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , and so on , are our <unk> mechanisms that we built in our community to be able to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and also capable of improving faster than we have been there .
so today , evolution can happen through the amount of microseconds .
you &apos;ve seen <unk> <unk> <unk> where he showed a little bit of evolution in the <unk> show you right now .
so now we have <unk> <unk> .
the first steps of history that i told you , <unk> , a billion years .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , <unk> several hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like speech and so forth , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , just seem to be a few decades .
the process is dependent on itself , and it is , i think <unk> is the word for -- if a little more <unk> increases .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that <unk> itself .
i &apos;m living in the age of computers , and i know that the mechanism i &apos;m using to build computers , not if we haven &apos;t been doing the latest advances in computing technology .
my current practice is to design objects with such a very complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for us to design these in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the <unk> .
it has billions of those .
what i do instead , what the designers of doing <unk> do is , we think , in some sense , <unk> , and the machine makes it something beyond our capabilities , better and faster than we could ever do it themselves .
and it does it in some ways , which we don &apos;t even understand .
so a way that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used a lot of time , is that evolution itself .
we put a <unk> in the machine that &apos;s going on in <unk> .
to give an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program which is designed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , there are a hundred million randomly chosen sequences sequences .
now , please follow all these randomly chosen instructions , run all the programs , and choose finally , which are what i believe in the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to rank numbers , that would be a simple example , which i used for it .
so , there are programs which are linking the numbers numbers .
of course , the chance of random randomly chosen instructions to be very small , because they &apos;re sort of <unk> numbers , just not actually the instructions to do this .
but one of them might be two numbers in the right order back .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that have come to my own <unk> .
it &apos;s pulling it down , <unk> the rest .
now <unk> , all the numbers that have the numbers on the best .
and with a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
two two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children are <unk> the characteristics of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that created by combinations of programs which came up with something that they were doing .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
<unk> them back .
maybe some mutations .
and try and do this again with another generation .
all of these generations are just a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through evolution through millions of years in the computer within a few minutes , or in many times , a couple more hours .
in the end , i &apos;ve got programs that are all <unk> .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program that i could have ever written by hand .
so when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell how they work .
i tried to understand them .
they &apos;re weird and weird programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to do the job because you come out of a series of <unk> programs that come the job .
because their life depended on whether they did the job .
i sat in a 747 , with marvin minsky , he &apos;d put a map of <unk> and he says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
it says , &quot; this plane consists of <unk> <unk> , which are working together to make their breath safer . &apos; don &apos;t do that ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not optimal , if it &apos;s too complicated .
so we &apos;re going to begin to leave computer , for a process , from the classical engineering process .
it allows us to deal with a much higher complexity than it would be able to produce normal people .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibility of it yet .
so <unk> <unk> us all the technology .
we use these programs to make the computer a lot faster , so that we can be able to do these processes even faster .
so it creates a <unk> .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies are feeding themselves from themselves .
we go up .
we &apos;re at a point , which is analogous to <unk> , as <unk> <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t just make sure what the hell we &apos;re really about to make .
we are in the middle of it .
but i really believe that after that there &apos;s something .
i think it &apos;s very simplistic to tell us that we are the most <unk> of evolution .
and i think all of this is part of the creation of what &apos;s always coming next .
now , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear this before i &apos;m going to go .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , two years ago .
i was under the sky with <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the era of ancient india &apos;s cricket . &quot;
if we wanted to go to <unk> , we were going to go to a car and think about the sky .
now we do it with airplanes .
back then , when the big indian <unk> <unk> gave him , he took a bow , fired into the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
we came up with the conclusion that magic and magic has been replaced by machines .
i made it really sad .
i got a fear of technology .
it was scared to me that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera , without texting , for my friends .
i thought technology can &apos;t do it and don &apos;t kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old old has become the <unk> thing to me .
she became a <unk> gateway to a world of pirates and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
i came up with it as we took our clocks clocks and cameras off of them .
they were going to be inspired by that .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use this magic to make magic .
and i started to cover books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a machine to storytelling that readers can around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it brings feedback and text together , animation animation and touch .
it &apos;s always a sense of storytelling .
but what are we doing ?
so i just go to <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s : &quot; finger your finger on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box heard ... &quot; i write my name .
and i will become a character in the book .
and again , a letter takes me down -- and the ipad can know by the internet where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the kid in me , really , really excites me .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean with the magician and kites , but the magic of childhood , those ideas we all had as children .
fireflies in fireflies , i found it quite exciting .
so you have to turn the ipad out of the ipad and the fireflies <unk> .
and the light away the way through the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be stuck inside .
and therefore , every book and this world is a little <unk> that i &apos;m looking around here with the magic device device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always been maps , but these cards were static .
this map grows and it stands and it stands for for some of the book .
it also shows you other places of the book .
i go in here .
it &apos;s important for me to create something that matters , but it &apos;s also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside of india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were <unk> thousands of years in <unk> <unk> .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history of children .
a story that we think about with new issues like <unk> .
the theme of <unk> , a big problem for the last 10 years is that children in their dorm room are sitting in their <unk> , without their <unk> .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children in the natural world with the technology .
in a <unk> of the book , you &apos;re going to be <unk> , you need to go out and you can take out the camera on the camera on the camera .
as a child , i had collections of <unk> , stones , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow the children don &apos;t .
this is going to be <unk> . you have to go out in order to take a picture of a flower in a chapter , and tag .
in another chapter , you have to have a piece of <unk> <unk> and mark .
this is how you actually create a digital collection of photographs that then can happen online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
this creates a kind of social collection around the collection of photographs that actually actually took .
there are a variety of possibilities with magic to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re designing a interaction at which you use the video of the ipads , and through <unk> <unk> reality animation can see the animation on the plant .
at one point , the screen is filled with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the scarf , you &apos;ll blow away and see the rest of the book .
we all move around to a world where the nature of technology is closer , and in the magic and technology can be able to play .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and closer to the natural world , and the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of history .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time living with people in <unk> , prisons , or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the socially weakest in the <unk> and in places where there is a lot of hopelessness .
and to be here at ted , to hear and hear how stimulating this is , has given a lot of power .
in the short time , it &apos;s been clear to me : ted has a identity .
you can say things that have the world influence .
and sometimes , when something comes to ted , it gets a meaning and force that doesn &apos;t have it .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher says , but they are meaningful in the words of a driven teacher .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do something more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i was raised in a family , a traditional household household , who was dominated by a <unk> , and that <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the starting point of many conflicts in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia .
she was born in 140 , and the experience of slavery became very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a young boy , she came up to me and i fell .
so it struck me that i could barely breathe , and then let me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; <unk> , do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said , no , said , <unk> me back again . when i said , &quot; i said it was quiet .
and she was something that she &apos;d always wanted to be close .
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of their children .
sometimes , when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins are all around around .
i remember , i must have eight or nine , that in the morning , i woke up and walked into the living room . all my cousins were <unk> .
my grandmother was at the end of my <unk> , staring at me .
first , i thought , that was a game .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
it was about 15 or 20 minutes . then she got up and came to me over this , and she got me on the hand , and he said , &quot; come on . &quot; and i , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember , it was yesterday .
i never forget it .
she took me out and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to promise you you don &apos;t want it . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised you . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you have to give me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , granny . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , first of all , you &apos;re going to love your mom always . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you &apos;ve got to promise you you always take care of you . &quot;
i mean my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
then she said , &quot; next thing to me is that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; but also it hard to do the right thing .
i thought , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you &apos;ve got to promise to you , &quot; is that you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise . &quot;
i grew up on the country , rural , rural south , and i have a brother who is a year older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , my brother came home and brought this <unk> beer with my sister and i went to the forest .
we just <unk> around just like that .
then he took a drink of beer and offered me my sister , and she took them to give me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . no . ok . do you . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do it . now we do it , but do whatever you do .
i had your sister , what was your sister . go to <unk> a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want it . does only do you . &quot;
my brother <unk> me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? well , what &apos;s going on ?
and then he looked at me and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not going to do you crazy about the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma &apos;s telling all the fact that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;ll tell you something .
i shouldn &apos;t do that .
this is going to be shown in public domain .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i <unk> that i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying this because i believe it &apos;s <unk> . i say that because identity matters .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people about things they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would tell all their grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was during the <unk> during prison .
my uncles died of infectious diseases .
and she believed that these were issues that we need to care .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in <unk> and in prison .
today , 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest <unk> of the world .
seven million people are <unk> on <unk> or <unk> .
in my opinion , our world has changed radically .
in socially weak and black parts of the population , fears are despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three of the <unk> between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , for <unk> , or <unk> .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles , philadelphia , on washington -- 50 to 60 percent of black black boys are either imprisoned in prison , in prison , on <unk> , or <unk> .
but our system is not just modeled by questions that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also transformed by poverty .
we have a system that has treated much better if they &apos;re rich and guilty , as poor and innocent .
wealth , not <unk> , influences the result .
yet , we seem to be very happy with this .
a politics of anger and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i find that interesting .
there are some <unk> developments .
my home state district keeps <unk> continuously if you &apos;re convicted of <unk> .
here in alabama , 60 percent of the male black <unk> are losing their <unk> .
we <unk> , in 10 years , the average of the civic <unk> are going to be as high as the <unk> of <unk> .
silence is <unk> .
i <unk> children .
many of my clients are young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , the <unk> children of death in prison .
in this country , we have <unk> children without <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;ve run a lot of work already .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the death of death penalty is an interesting question .
we believe that because we &apos;ve taught it that the real question is : does a man deserves to die for him from dying ?
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other perspective is not : did anybody deserve a crimes of death , but is it saving us to kill ?
i find that fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people we &apos;ve executed , one that we &apos;ve done for innocent innocent , the <unk> and the death death .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine years ago .
i find that fascinating .
we &apos;d never going to take somebody with an airplane , if you could shoot it out on nine planes going to crash .
but somehow we can bring it out of this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question whether we &apos;re right to kill it .
and it &apos;s exciting because i give my youngest african history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time to end up until the beginning of the world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the women in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people were afraid of <unk> .
or before .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
so these older people come back to me and say , &quot; mr , mr. <unk> , you can talk , you speak , you say it &apos;s the first time in our nation &apos;s history with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no , tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after , terrorism , of course , became the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and yet , there is a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we really don &apos;t really understand what our importance in our historical context .
we &apos;re going to <unk> them .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach ourselves the process of reconciliation and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the separation is not to overcome us without the willingness to become truth and reconciliation .
even the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given some talks about germany for the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the <unk> stood after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubling to listen to it . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death penalty .
and of course , there are no longer in germany .
it was still silent . then a woman said , &quot; in our history , it &apos;s impossible that we will ever give ourselves back to the systematic of people . &quot;
it would be <unk> by us and consciously <unk> people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel like living in a world where the german society would be <unk> , especially if most <unk> were a lot of jews .
it would be unbearable .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we &apos;re leaving people -- there &apos;s the risk of becoming death , 11 times higher when the victim is black , and the victim is white .
and yet there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t care about these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities of suffering , abuse , abuse , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we finally talk about hope that we need more hope , more commitment , to make in a complex world .
for me , to spend time and think about the poor , the vulnerable , the vulnerable , who will never be at ted .
but think about a way that is embedded in our own life .
we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re also rational as we appreciate it .
innovation , creativity , and development are not coming from our heads .
they come out of ideas that are driven by the conviction in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> , which i believe is driving them not to be open to all of the bright and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians , once said .
when we were fighting in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to be anything , but what we needed most needed was hope , one of them , hope , to be in certain places , to be witnessed .
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe is that the need to have to engage .
there &apos;s no boundary here to use technology and design that allows us to be human and be human , as long as we don &apos;t see and ears have poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges a lot more about us than we didn &apos;t care about it .
she &apos;s going to touch them .
as a young lawyer , i &apos;m trying to meet the great privilege to meet pink parks .
the parks had come back to <unk> , where they had two of their oldest friends , <unk> <unk> , who had organized the <unk> <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- and <unk> <unk> , who had been a <unk> , whose <unk> , <unk> king , dr. king <unk> .
so these women came together and they just worked .
and then , to the woman called <unk> me , and she said , &quot; <unk> , the park comes to the city . we want to talk .
do you want to listen and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , i like to say . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you are here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just stopped .
it was always inspiring , so inspiring .
one day i was sitting there , and i listened to these women , and after a couple of hours , a woman turned to me , to say , &quot; well , tell me what this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to be able to be injustice .
<unk> want to help people who were innocent convicted .
we want to fight bias and discrimination against the <unk> .
we want to eliminate <unk> <unk> without <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we want to do something about the death penalty company .
we want to lower the number of death .
we want to eliminate <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then a woman leaned in front of me , put my finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you need to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think that ted community should be <unk> .
we need to challenge ways to ask these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends from our humanity .
in my work , i learned the very simple things .
i learned a couple of simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
when somebody is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone does it , he doesn &apos;t hear it , he &apos;s not just a thief .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
and because that is , there &apos;s a basic human dignity that needs to respect the law .
i believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the planet , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think so .
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is .
and finally , i think , even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so inspiring , we &apos;re not measured at the end of our technology , not to the things we evolve , not based on our intellect and minds .
eventually , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but they &apos;re treated how to deal with the poor , the <unk> convicted .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly incredible things that we make .
sometimes i &apos;m losing a balance . it &apos;s a story .
sometimes i implore you very much .
i &apos;ll get tired of all .
sometimes these ideas are beginning to think about this very important way .
i <unk> these kids who were sentenced to very hard sentences .
i go to the <unk> and visit an clients who &apos;s 13 or 14 years old , and who is as an adult trial .
then i wonder , how could this happen ?
how does a judge do turn into something that he isn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed up too long , and i thought , my god , when a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should have some wishes .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think of it really , i started working on it .
i had a <unk> , poor black child as a client .
and i started with this bill . the headline was , &quot; <unk> , my poor , <unk> black clients , like a privileged , <unk> , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
in my bill , i explained that <unk> was the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
there was a crazy line of arguing about that , in this country , there are nothing more <unk> than that .
the next morning i woke up and didn &apos;t know if i was watching this crazy bill , or he actually wrote it .
and to my horror , i didn &apos;t just read it , but he was sent to the court .
a few months went , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to put into the dish and this crazy case .
i got into the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought , this is so hard , so painful .
finally , i went out of my car and went to the court .
when i went to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came up to me , and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
and then he whispered to me .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something deeply in me , identity , the ability of every single person contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you put this crazy bill ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i wrote these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office .
in the <unk> , the <unk> of people who were angry , we were talking about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my <unk> , i saw the janitors to go and go .
again , again , through the window and he could see all the <unk> .
he went up and down .
finally , this older black man came up with a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and she immediately went behind me , almost to the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge quit a pause .
during the pause , a <unk> fell in , which was that <unk> was in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran across to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
the older black york stood up . he looked at the <unk> , he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to come up with a young man , don &apos;t you lose your goal . don &apos;t give them out . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far superior , but it &apos;s <unk> .
that we are not being developed by humans as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and rights .
that our survival is bound by survival .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and creation , entertainment , creativity , with humanity , compassion and justice .
and most of all , i &apos;d like to leave those of you that you can see , just simply saying , don &apos;t you lose your goal out . don &apos;t give it .
you &apos;ve seen in this audience , this community community , i think , is to help them and do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring , where it &apos;s all about trying to do a <unk> , something from the <unk> <unk> that &apos;s going on in the <unk> of the <unk> .
here , in california , for example , in the next five years , a billion dollars for a death sentence is a billion dollars .
and yet , 90 percent of all of <unk> is not with a <unk> .
<unk> percent of all <unk> are not in court .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
this <unk> is going to suggest that money invested in more <unk> and safety .
i think there are opportunities .
over the last three decades , the <unk> has been <unk> enormously .
this is often given to a context of increasing <unk> .
what would you say to someone who believes this ?
now , in fact , the numbers don &apos;t change very much .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> for drugs .
so the dramatic levels come to the prisoner &apos;s dramatic .
we have <unk> ourselves by <unk> rhetoric .
now we have <unk> , <unk> people who provide people for bars behind for <unk> , for <unk> theft , that &apos;s what they are doing is forcing them to return to the things .
i think we need to do more people to help people who have become victims of a population , not less .
and i think our <unk> will not help it .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , they &apos;ve actually got a <unk> string .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
bin laden &apos;s got an increased <unk> of infection .
two lives in somalia . in britain , 3 : o.c. spray of police .
4 : an hiv epidemic . <unk> <unk> .
six billion people are heard : 65 deaths dead .
speech : eight . <unk> 9
different speakers : <unk> . weapons of mass destruction .
recession . disaster . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a couple of clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- it could have been the last six days , or for the last six years .
in fact , the media tend to be showing us negative questions , because our minds are paying attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second one day , our senses , much more information can actually process more information than our brain can .
and because it &apos;s nothing more important than our survival is the first stop for all of the information , part of our information network , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is the early detection system , our blood system .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> all of the information on the search for any of the environment in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer to think of the negative news .
and the old adage &quot; when it comes up , &quot; demand is increasing . &quot;
now , with all our digital technology that takes seven days a week , 24 hours a day , all of this negative news , is not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is getting worse .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the one .
maybe the enormous amount of progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces , so strongly that it will be us in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , water <unk> , water and water companies -- we &apos;ve got it .
and as humans , we are much better at seeing problems in a very long way , and yet to overcome them .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled the inflation of the population of the world &apos;s gdp has <unk> .
child mortality has reduced to a tenth .
that &apos;s where the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> cost to have a decrease .
steve pinker showed us that we currently live in a very peaceful time .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> in the last 130 years has been 25 percent to 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and a lot of people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we have poverty .
remember , a large percentage of americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , appliances , appliances , medium , cars and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of the world would have never have such <unk> <unk> .
the basis of a lot of it involves building technologies , and these are growing .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that gets into the information technology , the law of moore &apos;s law is great to do , and the <unk> of 12 million months is doubling .
that &apos;s how the costs in your pocket is about a million times less than a million times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law &apos;s last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth it does -- in good condition , war or peace , recession , depression , <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers , faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow down for any of our big problems .
also , despite your logarithmic <unk> on the left , it goes upwards .
so the rate of itself is accelerating .
and on that curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we &apos;re finding a series of extraordinary technologies that all available .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; which <unk> my friends at autodesk , <unk> sensors , networks , robots , robots , <unk> , enabling them to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , <unk> medicine and synthetic intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> <unk> watson at the risk ?
that was great .
i spent the newspaper <unk> , looking for the best headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson <unk> of the enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence would be given to the owner of any <unk> .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i &apos;m here at ted a new university , called &quot; university university . &quot;
we bring our students all these technologies , specifically focused on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , companies , products and services , in the decade , in a decade , are able to impact the lives of billions of people .
think about that a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people today .
thirty years ago , it would be <unk> .
today , we can refer to dozens of companies that have done this .
when i think of creating wealth , then i don &apos;t mean life with full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about to create a life of possibilities .
it &apos;s about spending a <unk> goods .
scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a <unk> force force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
the king of <unk> were <unk> .
aluminum was at the time the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable and gold .
this is why the dome of the <unk> was made of aluminum .
although aluminum <unk> percent of the <unk> needs , it &apos;s not as pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of technology was developed , and made it so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
and let &apos;s project this analogy to the future .
we think of <unk> today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that is filled with more energy than we spend a year .
16 percent energy energy takes all of the <unk> of the earth .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you know , for the first time , the cost of solar energy in india is 50 percent of <unk> percent -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy dropped in 50 percent .
last month , this has been published with a study that shows that until the end of the decade , the solar fields of solar energy , solar energy is six cents per square , which is compared to 15 cents a national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we also need water in abundance .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
do you remember that carl sagan was the <unk> in 1990 , when it was saturn , he turned back to earth ?
he took a famous photo . it was like it ?
&quot; a <unk> blue blue . &quot;
because we live on a live life .
we live on a planet that is down to 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent , and two percent are <unk> , and we fight around 55 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a talk today , with dean kamen , one of the innovators of them , he wants to share it with them -- he gave me permission -- his name of <unk> , which is a little bit of a <unk> in the <unk> .
it can make a thousand liters of clean drinking water every day from -- various saltwater , polluted water , <unk> water -- and all that &apos;s less than two cents a gallon .
the president of coca-cola has just begun to launch a great deal with a <unk> units in the developing world .
and when everything goes well , and i &apos;m very hopeful , then this will be global technology in <unk> countries around the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that exists today .
and we &apos;ve seen this with mobile phones .
you mean my goodness , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent of mobile phones in the developing way to the end of 2013 .
just think about a <unk> cell with a cell phone in the middle of kenya , a better <unk> <unk> than president reagan , 25 years ago .
and if you look at your smartphone on google , you have access access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that <unk> information and communication in the fact that nobody has ever predicted .
and it &apos;s getting better , the things that you and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photos , libraries of the medical imaging -- are literally <unk> and <unk> in your mobile phone .
and the best part of this is possibly what we expect .
last month , i had the pleasure of taking dinner with the &quot; $ 10 million <unk> <unk> x prize . &quot;
we put teams around the world to combine all these technologies together in one cell phone that you can speak to the device because it can be with ai , or <unk> your test .
and to win , the device has to get a better diagnosis than a team of <unk> doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and the health care of healthcare .
if this device uses a <unk> or <unk> , which is not known , calls it to stop and stop a pandemic before .
but now the biggest force that is going to lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the <unk> .
and by the way , the biggest <unk> to a population explosion is a better education and diet in the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
by 2020 , we move out of two billion <unk> .
three billion new minds we never have ever heard of , are going to connect global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what are they desire ?
and instead of an instant of <unk> , i see one of the greatest economic history of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow into the global economy .
and they will be trained by the use of the healthier , and they get trained in the <unk> and so they can have the opportunity to use 3d and <unk> nanoscale to be so much more than ever before .
so what can be three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the world ?
how about a set of new , never heard before .
how about it , the oppressed , wherever you are , to give a voice to make attention attention and change change , for the very first time ?
what will those three billion people bring ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned from the x prize is that small teams that are driven by passion and focus , extraordinary things can create things , things that large companies and governments can only create in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some of you might know .
it &apos;s a game called the foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to study how the protein is going to evolve .
and according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in <unk> .
so far , this is a problem with supercomputer .
and this game was played from the university university , etc .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that the human pattern is actually folded the protein as the best supercomputer .
and when these guys came and looked at who &apos;s the best part of the world , it wasn &apos;t a <unk> , not a <unk> , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working on the age of <unk> working in the night , and she was the best part of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to give us the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools of exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online for the new challenges , and to do that what necessary needs .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s starting to be a medical doctor , and i am .
and maybe i have a long time in business when i can give it a piece of my own <unk> <unk> to allow that to give you .
before i get to the actual subject of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are the <unk> near and we get to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; looks soon and turns around the statistics and make them make a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to refer to an statistics that i &apos;m hoping that most of you have already heard .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we talk about one 300 , when a knife is 300 .
that means that the player is safe at three beats .
that means the ball hits the ball , he gets up , he &apos;s not going to get caught , and who played the ball to the first base , didn &apos;t make it before , and the runner was safety .
three out of 10 .
do you know how to call a <unk> <unk> <unk> baseball ?
all right , well , maybe a <unk> .
do you know how to call a <unk> ?
this is somebody who &apos;s safe from the rest of 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> baseball players playing the course of the <unk> season at a time .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , which i feel about a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less likely that i &apos;ve talked about them about it .
suppose you have a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to get a <unk> <unk> whose <unk> is in terms of <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose they live in a certain remote area , and they have a beloved loved people with <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> that led to a <unk> whose <unk> is at 200 .
but , you know what ?
she &apos;s a lot better . she &apos;s on a rising star .
and she &apos;s <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in all the medicine knows what a good surgeon or the doctor should be <unk> or a doctor or a doctor .
but what we do is we have all of them to be locked up in the world with being perfect .
never make a mistake , no one does even make the details of how to be done .
and that &apos;s the message that i took in medical school .
i was a <unk> student .
in high school , a teacher told that brian <unk> was going to learn for a <unk> .
so it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in my sisters , <unk> hospital , <unk> from <unk> .
i learned everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and the <unk> every <unk> , every branch of a single artery , which is <unk> by the aorta , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the time i collected more and more .
and i was good , i graduated with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i knew it all knew and knew everything , or at least as much as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible that i was immune to doing mistakes .
and it was working for for a time , until i met a lot of a lot of ms. .
i went to a <unk> here in toronto , as a printer that was a printer in the hospital of the hospital .
at that point , i was appointed <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it was my assignment to see when the <unk> <unk> was looking for <unk> <unk> .
and i &apos;ll give feedback to my <unk> .
i studied woman <unk> , and she was in <unk> .
and when i listened to her , they made sound sounds .
and when i <unk> her chest , i was able to hear a sound sound on both sides , which told me she was suffering from heart failure .
this is a condition in the heart , instead of putting the whole blood flow down , you see a part of the blood vessels in the lung , and filling it up , and that &apos;s the <unk> .
and it wasn &apos;t a <unk> diagnosis .
i hired them , and i went to treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water , so that it <unk> the liquid .
and over a half of a half and a half hours , she started to feel better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take on the person , and i did what i should have had a phone call to my <unk> to him with him so he had a chance to have a real picture .
and he knew he was able to have some additional information to her information .
maybe i did .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to do so successful and as being able to take responsibility for me , and so i would be able to worry about my patients without having to contact him .
my second mistake was worse .
so that i sent them back home , i <unk> a quiet voice in me trying to say to me , &quot; <unk> , no good idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
in fact , i didn &apos;t miss the way that i asked the nurse that i was asking for a nurse , and do you believe it &apos;s okay , if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse was thinking about it , and i said , &quot; wow , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday yesterday .
so i took the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> and bring them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of that day , i had this feeling feeling in my stomach .
but i worked on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my little , leaving the hospital , and went to the parking lot to drive home , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went through my <unk> home .
and then a different nurse said that a lot of the sister who had seen a printer , but he had one of three three words , and those three words , most of whom i know .
other doctors , the other people fear that , but the <unk> is very special because we can actually see the patients so rare .
the three words said ?
&quot; do you remember the patients they asked at home ? &quot;
asked the nurse <unk> .
&quot; so she goes back , &quot; she said , &quot; she said .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after she ended up home , after she sent back home , she collapsed , and the family called 911 . and then they took them back to the <unk> blood pressure from 50 , which is a dangerous blood force .
she hardly barely breathe and was blue .
the <unk> broke all of these strands .
they gave their <unk> .
they agreed to <unk> them .
i was shocked and <unk> into the inner ear .
and i went through this rollercoaster because she came to the <unk> in the intensive care , and i hoped that she would recover .
and after two , three days , she realized it would never be awakening .
she didn &apos;t have suffered a <unk> .
your family together .
and over the next eight or nine days , they <unk> .
on the day day , she <unk> her -- she &apos;s a printer , a woman , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you don &apos;t forget the names of the <unk> .
and that was the first time i learned this .
the next couple of weeks i made claims , and i found the first time the unhealthy shame that existed in our medical society -- i felt alone alone , not the way of healthy shame that you feel because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy shame , if you have a secret of the best friend prize , although that one hits a <unk> , and then you get the best friend that you &apos;re faced with , and you get a happy ending with people who are never doing this kind of mistake .
if you make <unk> and make no mistakes again .
that &apos;s the kind of <unk> shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one in the <unk> sick .
it &apos;s the one that says , which is not what you &apos;ve done is bad , but you &apos;re bad at all .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t on the reason i was talking about .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure that he was <unk> and <unk> that i was not sued .
but i asked myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why do i ask them home ?
and then , in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
slowly it certainly did it .
i started to feel better .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke out , and i said , maybe i can feel better myself .
and i was obsessed with that , if i had to hold my efforts to perfection , never ever made a mistake that could make voice .
and she did .
and i worked on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the <unk> hospital in a hospital hospital in north america , and i <unk> a 25 year-old old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of it , and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the <unk> and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and yet , when he went out of the door , he showed up his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my nearest <unk> , and my <unk> asked me to a conversation in your office .
and she said the three words : remember you ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out he was a <unk> .
he had an potentially devastating disease called <unk> .
you can google it , but it &apos;s not an infection of the <unk> , but it <unk> the top of the <unk> .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> and lost a few days later .
and i went through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , feeling <unk> away from my work to get back and again and again .
in a <unk> , i have two <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of things to do , especially when you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that has only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i sent them home , and there was no imperfections in their treatment .
i thought he had <unk> .
i <unk> the x-ray of my kidneys , when it was without <unk> , my colleague at the <unk> of the patients had a <unk> in the lower right , and called the <unk> .
the other one had severe diarrhea .
i went to <unk> <unk> to him and asked my colleagues to myself .
and he did it , and he saw a <unk> in the right down sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and it was fine .
both cases of <unk> at me , <unk> me .
and i &apos;d be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened in the first five years , what i think of all of my colleagues , but total nonsense .
some of my previous <unk> happened in the last five years .
alone , van and no support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i &apos;m going to close with my failures , and i can talk about it , if i &apos;m talking to the quiet voice that tells me what really happened , how can i do it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you think about me .
when did you see the last time by someone talking about <unk> about <unk> <unk> ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and there you may be heard about any other doctor , but you won &apos;t hear somebody talk about your own mistakes .
if i was in a room full of colleagues , and i want to ask your immediate support , and let me tell you what i just told you about , i would not end up with the end of the second story before you would get the topic , and you would forget the topic .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues knew that a hospital in my hospital would have saved someone &apos;s wrong leg , then i believe i had to have some problems in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who are doing and the ones that make mistakes and the ones that don &apos;t do , the people who constrains <unk> and the <unk> , who with bad results , with good results .
it &apos;s almost an <unk> reaction , like antibodies , that attack a person .
and there is the idea that if we can <unk> the mistakes from medicine , that we have a secure system .
but there are two problems .
in my 20 years of medical research and journalism , i have a personal health study in medical imaging and <unk> treatments to give you all possible for me for one of my first magazine that i was &quot; the white <unk> , black . &quot;
and what i learned is that error is absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system in every single day where one of the 10 <unk> are either <unk> or false <unk> , which is always the wrong and <unk> and more and become more devastation and devastation .
in this state , 90 states must die in <unk> .
in the united states , the <unk> institute has been the institute for 100,000 .
both are strong <unk> , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> where the knowledge of all about three or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have cognitive cognitive , so we can take a perfect test for a patient with a chest pain .
then i take the same patient with <unk> , making it <unk> and <unk> and <unk> slightly more intense , and suddenly , the story is <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same stages .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things in the same way .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way .
in all of that , error is inevitable .
so if you take the system like the way i &apos;ve been taught , and all <unk> <unk> <unk> , then nobody &apos;s going to be left .
and you know the people who are talking about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , the other kind of thing , &quot; i mean the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake . &quot;
and then your lens turns out , you &apos;ve hit your head , then you look down , and you &apos;re getting hard to swallow and begin to tell you stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same mistake i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what they need is an environment that takes them up .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new organization is defined as a human being knows about his humanity , she &apos;s accepted to be a pride of mistake , but it &apos;s all going to learn from it so that it can passed on .
she shares their experiences with others .
it &apos;s supporting if others are talking about their mistakes .
and she shares other their mistakes , not for <unk> , but in a loving , supportive way that everybody is going to benefit .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that is , then people make mistakes from time to time .
so the way that the system evolved to create <unk> is to find the easier ways to make people <unk> , and also enables people to be engaged , and that is also empowering for the potential .
my name is brian goldman .
i am the new organization .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
but i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m also trying to learn best to get it to share it .
i don &apos;t know what i think about it , but i can live with that .
let me close with my three words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i will tell you three stories to tell you the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was <unk> here .
you may think that he blew up , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described one of them as <unk> .
it was a <unk> .
up until the &apos; 80s , he was enjoying great scale .
now he &apos;s listed in the red list .
this is a story many times many of the galapagos or the other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we &apos;re still coming to the galapagos .
we still think they were ancient .
the <unk> tells you still as pristine .
what happened here ?
the second story is to adopt a different concept , <unk> <unk> .
because i experienced it when i was in a <unk> lagoon in <unk> .
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i was convinced that i was really not from there .
it was my first <unk> .
you see , the lagoon was <unk> by a <unk> of <unk> .
there was <unk> about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen lived well , and made better in ghana above average .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half of its size .
and we have five inches .
they had been genetically modified .
there were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was also fortunate to be there .
so it changed nothing , but it changed everything .
my third little story story about my <unk> in <unk> asia .
in the 1970s , rather than the beginning of the 60s -- the <unk> europe has a lot of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which had been a thousand fish that had been doing a fish that was a pretty ugly ship called <unk> .
i went on to that , and we did all the southern coastal ocean , particularly in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started .
i know now it was the bottom of the sea .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the cause .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there in the rubble , the <unk> were <unk> .
basically , the essence of the sea went down , and then it became <unk> .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast .
within a year , we did a census , and then starts with the commercial fisheries .
the reason is changing . in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals will be <unk> .
this is a dead turtle .
they were not eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living .
she wasn &apos;t <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain will fall up from hundreds of rubble every day when they drive into areas that have never been fish .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our <unk> to the new level , and we don &apos;t want to remind us of what &apos;s there .
if you <unk> it , it happens .
on the y-axis are a couple of good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of their country , the <unk> .
it &apos;s changing , and it &apos;s changing , because people are kind of changes .
every generation of looking at the images that take them on the start of their conscious life as the standard and everything can pull from it .
the difference is perceived as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can give a sequence of changes .
and in the end , they just want to preserve the <unk> remains .
that &apos;s now largely our goal .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are not more like they were .
you might think that the problem was people , if you lived in <unk> societies , killing animals , and only after a few generations , what they had done .
because obviously , an animal that has been very common , even even before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of common animals .
you &apos;re still in rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not going to be seen as a loss .
at the time we focus on the large animals and the sea is the big fish .
they become rarer because they &apos;re catching them .
there &apos;s a little bit of fish left , and we think this is the <unk> .
the question is why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
you will confirm it , because the evidence of how you do in those earlier forms , are not as the evidence that you would like to see the evidence .
so for instance , it &apos;s an anecdote , the reports that a report that we saw in this area of large <unk> could not be used , or from <unk> doesn &apos;t usually be <unk> because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that the people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the huge big role that can be a protected area .
because , as marine protected , we are making the past .
we make the back back that people can &apos;t understand , because the changes have changed and they are very low .
and so the people who see a marine protected , and that benefit from the insight that enables it to reset their <unk> .
what about the people who are not possible because they don &apos;t have access to the people in the midwest , for example ?
and here i think the art and the film might fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of the bay bay .
a long time ago , there were <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> may you remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
when you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were so touched -- except from the <unk> , why were you so close to the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in some sense .
so my recommendation , the one that i &apos;ll give you , focuses on cameron so that he &apos;s called &quot; avatar ii . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 30s , in communist <unk> , you had to be using a typewriter on this government .
they also had to put a sheet with <unk> out of this typewriter .
the reason for this is , the government could trace where a text came from .
so they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could help the idea of the idea .
and we couldn &apos;t understand the way that anybody could do this , and how much would allow the freedom of freedom .
in our own countries , we would never do this .
but if you &apos;re buying a new <unk> of <unk> , you can buy one page page , and then print them page , it &apos;s got this yellow yellow flag on every page page , in a pattern , and the one that <unk> the one hand down and down your printer .
this is what happens to us today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem <unk> .
and this was an example of what our own governments are using technology to us against the citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> of <unk> today .
so let &apos;s look at what &apos;s happening in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from ukraine in ukraine .
and the <unk> of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> , <unk> , who saved their money by attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watt .
<unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth .
these people have come online , but they &apos;ve been investing on their own by using <unk> , to use money from our <unk> , to <unk> money from the <unk> , while we &apos;re going to <unk> our <unk> online , while we &apos;re going to buy over online computers .
the u.s. intelligence agency <unk> two months ago , swiss swiss accounts for mr. sam jain here , and on this survey , there were <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain itself is on <unk> , the <unk> is unknown .
and i want to argue that it &apos;s more likely to be that we are victims of a year than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be even worse .
in the future , most of the crimes are happening online .
the second biggest <unk> we can see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , a opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous are over the last 12 months and moved to one of the <unk> of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who are doing the money for the <unk> , <unk> like anonymous , who are <unk> , but the last group are nations , governments that are <unk> attacks .
there are times when we were talking about .
it shows a lot of what happens when governments are going to attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> in the netherlands -- and it was .
in the last autumn , it had to be <unk> <unk> , because <unk> had been hacked .
somebody was hacked and had the system hacked .
and last week at a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior students that we could ask whether to be able to get it for possible because of the <unk> people had died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in such a dirty way ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a certificate is , if you have a website with <unk> , with <unk> service , for email service .
now we all use , or many of us , gmail , or one of their competitors , but those services are widely distributed in <unk> states , like the iran , where the <unk> can be <unk> and <unk> , so that the local government can &apos;t be able to <unk> in their conversation .
but can you find yourself in a foreign .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in <unk> .
how does it acts with the arab spring and things that are happening in egypt ?
now , in egypt , they were <unk> in the headquarters of the egyptian headquarters headquarters for egyptian egyptian , and they found a lot of records .
in this records there was a folder called <unk> .
and in this folder , there &apos;s a company that was involved in germany , and the egyptian government sold a few programs that they had -- in very large scale , controlled communication of egyptian people citizens .
they had this program for <unk> dollars to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western governments are <unk> governments with <unk> that can make their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , in a couple of weeks ago , called <unk> <unk> , which was a <unk> <unk> , which was used by german <unk> to make their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in a <unk> , it &apos;s almost <unk> your phone .
but today we &apos;re far beyond .
they tap on their internet connection .
they use tools like <unk> to <unk> their computer with a <unk> <unk> that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , their <unk> .
so if we think about thinking about these things , the obvious answer of the people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not me , because i am a citizen citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument makes no sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we have today , 2011 , our governments like trust , is all right , we &apos;re always going to be responsible for always forever .
and we trust , we trust ourselves in one of the future government , a government that we may have maybe in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to spend the next 50 years .
it may seem weird to me , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , with a very simple idea : modules that fit together with cement <unk> .
<unk> became very fast <unk> in the world .
they gave us the machine to build things larger than we , buildings , bridges , one stone after another .
basically , the <unk> was the building block of our time .
for a hundred years later , in 1947 , there was lego with this .
it was called &quot; <unk> <unk> stone . &quot;
and within less years , lego would be lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones have been produced , or 75 stones for each person on this planet .
you don &apos;t need to be an engineer to build beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
lego made it for all possible .
lego basically created the <unk> , the building block of the world , and made a block for our imagination .
in the course of the bell , the bell labs started the next revolution , the next building block .
the transistor was a small <unk> that was moving back from a world of static <unk> building blocks to a world that was interactive .
like the <unk> , the transistor allows us to make the more complex more efficient loops , one stone after another .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time is for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started exploring this idea , how do the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers ?
a few years ago , i started developing research therapy .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect together with magnets .
so they can &apos;t put them wrong .
the rocks are <unk> .
green is key , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange .
so , all you need to do is to be a blue and a green one , and you can build a very large building bigger .
they put a blue on a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch between them , and they put a little <unk> .
take the box out there &apos;s a <unk> , which is here to insert in here , and you &apos;ve made a little <unk> .
so , you add these <unk> for an extra effect , and they made a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple game , it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
instead of being , coding , <unk> or <unk> , allows them to combine them with simple , intuitive gestures .
so , to slow the flash faster or slow down , just rotate to this button , and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind it is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world into a <unk> .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we have spread in children on children , and they &apos;re playing with them .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is how they begin to understand the electronics in the world , and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like , for example , a <unk> works , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or how the ipod responds to touch .
we also brought <unk> <unk> .
so , for example , we didn &apos;t have an experience with no experience in electronic things that began to play with materials as a material .
here we see with <unk> , paper and water , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we put exhibitions in risd and gave them some designers that didn &apos;t have any technical experience -- just cardboard box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a hummer that is afraid of <unk> .
for those <unk> , <unk> , another piece of electronics , electronics have just been another material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so , open source source .
you can go to the website , download all the <unk> download content and make it yourself .
we want the creators of creators , the creators who encourage the <unk> , because the world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , they go ahead and start building up .
thank you .
